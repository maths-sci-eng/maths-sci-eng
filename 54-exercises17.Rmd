# Exercise Set 17 {-}

1. A normally distributed random variable $X$ has mean $1$
and variance $4$. Using tables, find 
    a. $P(X>0)$ 
    a. $P(X<2)$
    a. $P(|X|<1)$
    a. the value of $c$ such that $P(X<c)=0.0643$

1. A normally distributed random variable $X$ has mean 1 and variance 5. Using tables, find:
    a. $P(X > 1)$
    a. $P(|X| < 0.1)$
    a. The value of $c$ such that $P(X < c) = 0.01287$

1. A thermostat is set to switch at $20^\circ\,\text{C}$ operates in a range of temperatures with a mean value of $20.4^\circ\,\text{C}$ and a standard deviation of $1.3^\circ\,\text{C}$. What is the probability that its operating temperature will fall between $19.5^\circ\,\text{C}$ and $20.5^\circ\,\text{C}$? 

1. The life of a drill has a mean of 16 hours and a standard deviation of 2.6 hours. Assuming it is normally distributed determine the probability of a bit lasting
    a. More than 20 hours.
    a. Less than 14 hours.
