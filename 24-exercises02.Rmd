# Exercise Set 2 {-}

These exercises cover the topics of Functions and Graphs.

1. Sketch the graphs of the following functions on the interval $-2\le x \le 2$.
    a. $y=-\frac{1}{2}(x+1)$
    a. $y=x^2+2$
    a. $y=-2x^2+2$
    a. $y=x^2-x-1$
    a. $y=3^x$
    a. $y=\frac{1}{x}$

    Tips: find where the functions cross the axes; use completing the square to find the maximum or minimum of quadratics; identify any asymptotes.

1. Sketch the following graphs (with $x$ in radians):
    a. $y=\sin(x)$
    a. $y=\sin(x+\frac{\pi}{2})$ (does this look familiar?)
    a. $y=\sin(2x)$
    a. $y=\sin^2(x)$

1. If we had the graph of a function $f(x)$, describe what would change qualitatively for the graph of $f(a\times x)$ where $a$ is a constant. Consider the cases:
    a. $a>1$
    a. $0 < a < 1$
    a. $-1 < a < 0$
    a. $a<-1$

 1. If we had the graph of a function $f(x)$, describe what would change qualitatively for the graph of $f(x+b)$ where $b$ is a constant. Consider the cases:
    a. $b>0$
    a. $b<0$

 1. If we had the graph of a function $f(x)$, describe what would change qualitatively for the graph of $f(x)+c$ where $c$ is a constant. Consider the cases:
    a. $c>0$
    a. $c<0$
