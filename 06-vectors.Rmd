# Vectors

In physics, we distiguish between *scalar* quantities and *vector* quantities:
* Scalars are defined by a single numeric value. Examples include distance, speed, time, temperature, pressure, mass and energy.
* Vectors have associated both a numeric value and a direction. Examples include displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, and momentum.

We depict vectors by arrows whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the quantity in question and whose direction is that of the action of the quantity. In symbols, we will use bold typeface to indicate a vector, such as $\mathbf{v}$, and we will denote a vector from point $A$ to $B$ by $\overrightarrow{AB}$. See figure \@ref(fig:vector).

```{r vector, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$ is the vector from $A$ to $B$.", fig.alt = "A vector $\\mathbf{v}$ between points $A$ and $B$.", out.width= "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/vector.png")
```


## Vector addition

Geometrically, to add two vectors together we can place the tail of one vector at the head of the other and take the vector that goes from the starting point to the finish point.

```{r label, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Addition of two vectors $\\textbf{v}$ and $\\textbf{w}$ by aligning them tail to head.", fig.alt = "Geometric addition of two vectors $\\textbf{v}$ and $\\textbf{w}$ by aligning them tail to head.", out.width= "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/vecadd.png")
```

::: {.example #vecadd name="Vector addition"}
A swallow is flying at 40 km/h due north with an easterly wind blowing at a speed of 20 km/h. The swallow's groundspeed can be found by adding the velocity vectors:
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{v} &= 40 \text{ km/h North}\\
\mathbf{w} &= 20 \text{ km/h West}\\
\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w}&=20\sqrt{5} \text{ km/h North by North West}.
\end{align*}
:::

Alternatively, we can use the parallelogram rule (which amounts to the same thing): we draw a parallelogram with two of the non-parallel sides given by the vectors and take the diagonal as the resultant vector, as in figure \@ref(fig:vecaddpara).


```{r vecaddpara, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Parallelogram for addition of two vectors $\\textbf{v}$ and $\\textbf{w}$.", fig.alt = "Parallelogram for addition of two vectors $\\textbf{v}$ and $\\textbf{w}$.", fig.align = 'center', out.width= "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/vecaddpara.png")
```

## Scalar multiplication

If we multiply a vector by a positive scalar, we change only the magnitude of the vector and keep its direction. For example, if the swallow in example \@ref(exm:vecadd) starts flying twice as fast, we have the velocity vector
$$2\mathbf{v} = 80 \text{ km/h North}.$$
If we multiply by a negative value, the vector now points in the opposite direction:
$$-2\mathbf{v} = 80 \text{ km/h South}.$$

```{r scalarmult, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Scalar multiplication of a vector $\\mathbf{v}$.", fig.alt = "Scalar multiplication of a vector $\\mathbf{v}$.", out.width= "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/scalarmult.png")
```

Finally, if we multiply by $0$, we get the *zero-vector* $\mathbf{0}$, which has magnitude $0$ and no direction:
$$0\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0}$$.


## Vectors in Cartesian coordinates

We mostly deal with vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system. We then define vectors of length 1 that point out from the origin along the coordinate axes. In three dimensions we label these as $\mathbf{i}$ along the $x$-axis, $\mathbf{j}$ along the $y$-axis and $\mathbf{k}$ along the $z$-axis. In two dimensions we simply drop the $\mathbf{k}$ vector.

We can then write any vector $\overrightarrow{OA}$ from the origin $O$ to a point $A$ as some combination of the these vectors. For example, the vector in the plane from the origin to the point $A=(2,3)$ is given by:
$$\overrightarrow{OA}=2\mathbf{i} + 3\mathbf{j}.$$
We can reconcile this with our geometric understanding of addition of two vectors: we place the vector $2\mathbf{i}$ from the origin to the point $(2,0)$ and then place the tail of the vector $3\mathbf{j}$ at the head of $2\mathbf{i}$ to get to the point $(2,3)$; or, in terms of the parallelogram rule we have a rectangle with sides $2\mathbf{i}$ and $3\mathbf{j}$. See figure \@ref(fig:coordvecs).

```{r coordvecs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The vector $2\\mathbf{i}+3\\mathbf{j}$.", fig.alt = "The vector $2\\mathbf{i}+3\\mathbf{j}$.", out.width= "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/coordvecs.png")
```

Yet another way to write this vector is as a *column vector*
$$\overrightarrow{OA}=
\begin{pmatrix}
2\\
3
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Such a representation is called a *coordinate vector*.
More generally, the vector
$$\mathbf{v}=x\mathbf{i}+y\mathbf{j}+z\mathbf{k}$$
can be written as the column
$$\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Now addition and scalar multiplication can be carried out component-wise as follows. If we have
$$\mathbf{v}=x\mathbf{i}+y\mathbf{j}+z\mathbf{k}$$
and
$$\mathbf{w}=x'\mathbf{i}+y'\mathbf{j}+z'\mathbf{k}$$
then
$$\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w}=(x+x')\mathbf{i}+(y+y')\mathbf{j}+(z+z')\mathbf{k}$$
and with $a$ a scalar,
$$a\mathbf{v}=ax\mathbf{i}+ay\mathbf{j}+az\mathbf{k}.$$

Or, as column vectors with
$$
\mathbf{v} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix},
\qquad
\mathbf{w} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
x'\\
y'\\
z'
\end{pmatrix}
$$
we have
$$\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w}= \begin{pmatrix}
x+x'\\
y+y'\\
z+z'
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
and
$$
a\mathbf{v} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
ax\\
ay\\
az
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

If points $A$ and $B$ have coordinates $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ and $(b_1,b_2,b_3)$, respectively, then the vector from $A$ to $B$ is
$$\overrightarrow{AB} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 - a_1 \\ b_2 - a_2\\ b_3 - a_3\end{pmatrix}.
$$
In 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, the *length* of the vector
$$\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x\\ y\\ z\end{pmatrix}$$
is written as $|\mathbf{v}|$ and defined as
$$|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$$.
This is essentially a three-dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem.

A vector $\mathbf{u}$ is said to be a *unit vector* if it has unit length. That is, if $|\mathbf{u}| = 1$. For any non-zero vector $\mathbf{v}$, the vector
$$
\mathbf{u}=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{v}|} \mathbf{v}
$$
is a unit vector in the same direction as $\mathbf{v}$.

::: {.example #unitvec}
Let 
$$\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2\\ -3\\ 6\end{pmatrix}$$

Then the length of $\mathbf{v}$ is $|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2} = 7$. So the unit vector $\mathbf{u}$ parallel to $\mathbf{v}$ is
$$
\mathbf{u}=\frac{1}{7}\begin{pmatrix} 2\\ -3\\ 6\end{pmatrix}.
$$

## Vector products

We have seen how to add vectors and how to multiply vectors with a scalar. In the following, we see how to multiply two vectors with each other.

### Dot product

The *dot product* (also called the *scalar product* or *inner product*) of two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, denoted $\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}$, is defined to be the quantity
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{u}||\mathbf{v}|\cos(\theta)
(\#eq:dotprod)
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$. Note that the symmetry of the $\cos$ function means it does not matter which direction we measure the angle, i.e. clockwise or anticlockwise.

```{r dotproj, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The projection of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto $\\mathbf{u}$.", fig.alt = "The projection of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto $\\mathbf{u}$.", out.width= "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/dotproj.png")
```
An immediate application of the scalar product is the projection of one vector onto another. Consider Figure \@ref(fig:dotproj), which shows the projection of the vector $\mathbf{v}$ onto the vector $\mathbf{u}$. We drop a line from the tip of $\mathbf{v}$ running at right angles to the direction of the vector $\mathbf{u}$. This is akin to thinking of the shadow that $\mathbf{v}$ would cast on the vector $\mathbf{u}$ if the Sun is shining at right angles to $\mathbf{u}$. The length of the shadow is the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{u}$, or
$$|\mathbf{v}|\cos(\theta).$$
Since there was nothing special about choosing $\mathbf{v}$, it is also true that the dot product is the projection of $\mathbf{u}$ onto $\mathbf{v}$, that is
\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} &= |\mathbf{u}| \times \text{projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{u}$}\\
	&= |\mathbf{v}| \times \text{projection of $\mathbf{u}$ onto $\mathbf{v}$}.
\end{align*}

Note that if the dot product is $\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}=0$ then either $\cos(\frac{\pi}{2})=0$ so that the two vectors are perpendicular, or one or both of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are the zero vector $\mathbf{0}$. When the dot product is zero, we say that the two vectors are *orthogonal*.

Some other properties of the dot product that follow from the definition are:

* $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}$;
* $(a\mathbf{u}) \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u} \cdot (a\mathbf{v})= a(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v})$;
* $\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w}$;
* $\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u} = |\mathbf{u}|^2$.

In Cartesian coordinates, the dot product of two vectors
$$\mathbf{u} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} + z\mathbf{k} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \mathbf{v} = a\mathbf{i} + b\mathbf{j} + c\mathbf{k}$$
can be calulated as
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v} = (x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} + z\mathbf{k})\cdot(a\mathbf{i} + b\mathbf{j} + c\mathbf{k}) = xa + yb + zc.
\end{equation*}

To see this, consider the full product:
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} &= xa \mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{i} + xb \mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{j} + xc \mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{k} \\
&\phantom{={}} + ya \mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{i} + yb \mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{j} + yc \mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{k} \\
&\phantom{={}} + za \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{i} + zb \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{j} + zc \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k} \\
&= xa + yb + zc,
\end{align*}
then noting that the unit vectors $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$ and $\mathbf{k}$ have unit length and are perpendicular to one another, we first have by the property $\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u}=|\mathbf{u}|^2$ that
$$
\mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{i} = \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{j} =\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k}=1,
$$
and secondly, by orthogonality each of the following products are zero 
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{j}&,\; \mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{k}\\
\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{i}&,\; \mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{k}\\
\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{i}&,\; \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{j}.
\end{align*}
