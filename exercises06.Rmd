The voltage drop across a resistor is (by Ohm's law) $V=IR$ where $V$ is in volts, the current $I$ is in amps and the resistance $R$ is in ohms.
Kirchhoff's junction law: the sum of currents flowing into a junction is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that junction.
Kirchoff's Voltage law: The sum of the voltage drops in one direction around a loop equals the sum of the voltage sources in the same direction around the loop.
Using these laws it is possible to derive the following set of linear equations for the currents $I_1, I_2, I_3$:

\begin{align*}
11I_1-3I_2&=30\\
-3I_1+6I_2-I_3&=5\\
-I_2+3I_3&=-25.
\end{align*}

Determine the currents.

1. Balancing Chemical equations. In the combustion of propane gas, propane (C_3H_8) combines with oxygen (O_2) to form carbon dioxide (CO_2) and water (H_2O) according to the equation
$$x_1 \text{C_3H_8} + x_2 \text{O_2}\to x_3\text{CO_2}+x_4\text{H_2O}.$$
To balance this equation, we must find natural numbers $x_1, x_2, x_3,x_4$ such that the total numbers of C, H and O atoms are equal on both sides. Formulate this as a set of linear equations and solve using Guassian elimination.
