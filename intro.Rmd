Roots of complex numbers

We know that square roots of positive real numbers have two solutions, for example $\sqrt{4}=\pm 2$. This agrees with Theorem \ref@(thm:FTA) as we could formulate this as a solution to the equation

$$x^2=4$$

which is the quadratic

$$x^2-4=0$$

and so must have two roots. More generally, the $n^\text{th}$ root of any number $w$ can be formulated as the solutions to the polynomial equation

$$z^n-w=0.$$

Theorem \ref@(thm:FTA) implies that there are $n$ solutions, allowing for these to be complex numbers. Furthermore, it turns out that these roots will be distinct (no repeated roots). The easiest way to find these roots is using the exponential form. We can write $w$ as

$$w=re^{i\theta}$$

then the first $n^\text{th}$ root is

$$w^{\frac{1}{n}}=(re^{i\theta})^\frac{1}{n}=r^\frac{1}{n}e^{i\frac{\theta}{n}}$$

but where are the remaining $n-1$ roots? Well, since we can also write $w=re^{i(\theta+2m\pi)}$, so

$$w^{\frac{1}{n}=r^{\frac{1}{n}e^{i(\frac{\theta}{n}+\frac{2m}{n}\pi)}$$

and we have a distinct solution for all values of $m=0,\dotsc,n-1$. Once we reach $m=n$ we have gone full circle and are back to the original solution. To double check these are solutions, we can take them to the power $n$

\begin{align*}
(r^{\frac{1}{n}e^{i(\frac{\theta}{n}+\frac{2m}{n}\pi)})^n&=re^{in(\frac{\theta}{n}+\frac{2m}{n}\pi)}\\
&=re^{i(\frac{n\theta}{n}+\frac{2mn}{n}\pi)}\\
&=re^{i(\theta+2m\pi)}\\
&=re^{i\theta}\\
&=w.
\end{align*}

Geometrically, these $n$ solutions are evenly spaced around a circle of radius $r^{\frac{1}{n}}$ in the complex plane, with an angle of $\frac{2}{n}\pi$ between them.
