The set of natural numbers are the familiar counting numbers: \\[1, 2, 3,\\dotsc\\] We denote these by the symbol \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). The integers are the whole numbers, which include zero and negative numbers: \\[\\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\\dots\\] We denote these by the symbol \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). We sometimes want to focus on just the positive integers, which is another name for the natural numbers. The non-negative integers are the numbers: \\[0, 1, 2, 3,\\dotsc\\] (the natural numbers and zero). The negative integers are the numbers: \\[-1, -2, -3,\\dotsc\\] The rational numbers are numbers which can be written in the form \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, with \\(b\\neq 0\\), so numbers like \\[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}, -\\frac{4}{5}, \\dotsc\\] Note these include the integers since they can be written as \\(\\frac{a}{1}\\). Rational numbers are denoted \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). The ancient Greeks discovered that there are numbers that are not rational  so-called irrational numbers. For example, \\(\\sqrt{2}, \\pi\\) and \\(e\\) are all irrational numbers. One way of characterising irrational numbers is that they have a decimal representation that never repeats \\[ \\pi=3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820\\dots \\] In contrast, all rational numbers have an eventually repeating decimal expansion (after perhaps some initial jumble of digits, there is a repeating pattern), for example: Rational Number Repeating pattern \\(\\frac{1}{3}=0.333\\dots\\) repeating \\(3\\)s \\(\\frac{3}{2}=1.5000\\dots\\) repeating \\(0\\)s after the first decimal digit, which we normally dont write down! \\(\\frac{219}{1750}=0.125142857142857\\dots\\) repeating sequence \\(142857\\) of length \\(6\\) after the first \\(3\\) decimal digits The real numbers consist of all rational and irrational numbers together. We can think of real numbers as points on a continuous straight line, or as numbers that possibly have a decimal representation requiring an infinite number of digits1. The set of real numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We learn about all of the above numbers early on in our mathematical education. However, there is a further set of numbers that is very useful in science and engineering that you may not have encountered before: the complex numbers, denoted by \\(\\mathbb{C}\\). These are not as intuitive as real numbers and we explore them in detail in section 5. 1.2 Algebra This section contains some basic algebraic rules. Fluency with notation and manipulations allows us to progress to higher level mathematics with ease. We are familiar with the basic rules of arithmetic: \\(+, -, \\times, \\div\\). When an expression contains multiple operations we can use brackets to indicate the order in which the operations are executed. We also commonly use powers (exponents). When evaluating an expression, remember to use the mnemonic BEDMAS, which defines the precedence of these operations: B - Brackets E - Exponents D - Division M - Multiplication A - Addition S - Subtraction Division and Multiplication can be carried out in either order, as can Addition and Subtraction. Well recap the rules of Brackets and Exponents in the next sections. Example 1.1 (BEDMAS) We have \\[3+2\\times 4=11,\\] whilst \\[(3+2)\\times 4 = 20.\\] 1.2.1 Rules of Exponents In their most basic form, we use exponents as a shorthand for multiplication of a number by itself some positive integer number of times. For example: \\(5\\times 5 = 5^2\\) spoken as 5 squared \\(5\\times 5\\times 5=5^3\\) spoken as 5 cubed and more generally, for any real number \\(x\\) and positive integer \\(n\\), \\(\\underbrace{x\\times \\dotsb \\times x}_{\\text{with }n\\, x\\text{&#39;s}} = x^n\\) spoken as x to the power \\(n\\) The number \\(x\\) is known as the base and the number \\(n\\) is known as the power, index or exponent. Now for any real number \\(x\\) and positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it should be clear that the following rule holds: Theorem 1.1 (Rule 1) \\[x^ax^b=x^{a+b}\\] since we are multiplying \\(a\\) \\(x\\)s by a further \\(b\\) \\(x\\)s to give a total of \\(a+b\\) \\(x\\)s multiplied together. Extending this idea, we also have: Theorem 1.1 (Rule 2) \\[(x^a)^b=x^{ab}\\] Exercise 1.1 Why does Rule 2 hold? Can you prove it using Rule 1? Furthermore, show that \\((x^a)^b=(x^b)^a\\). So far we have allowed the exponents to be positive integers. Can we make sense of negative integers as exponents? Consider for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as positive integers the product \\[x^a\\frac{1}{x^b}=\\frac{x^a}{x^b}\\] For arguments sake lets take \\(a&gt;b\\), then since we have \\(a\\) \\(x\\)s on the top and \\(b\\) \\(x\\)s on the bottom, we can cancel the common factors to leave \\(a-b\\) \\(x\\)s. So, \\[\\begin{equation} x^a\\frac{1}{x^b}=\\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] and following Rule 1 we could think of this as \\(x^{a-b}=x^{a+(-b)}=x^ax^{-b}\\), and therefore using a negative exponent \\(-b\\) gives the reciprocal of \\(x^b\\). Theorem 1.1 (Rule 3) \\[x^{-a}=\\frac{1}{x^a}\\] Next, we can consider the value of \\(x^0\\). In (1.1) with the particular case \\(b=a\\), we have \\[1=\\frac{x^a}{x^a}=x^{a-a}=x^0\\] so we get that for any non-zero2 value of \\(x\\): Theorem 1.2 (Rule 4) \\[x^0=1\\] Now lets try to make sense of a power of the form \\(x^{\\frac{a}{b}}\\) where \\(a\\) is an integer and \\(b\\) is a positive integer. That is, we now allow for fractional (otherwise known as rational) exponents. Since we have \\(\\frac{a}{b}=a\\frac{1}{b}\\) we can write (using Rule 2): \\[x^{\\frac{a}{b}}=(x^a)^{\\frac{1}{b}}.\\] In the case \\(b=a\\), we therefore have \\[x=x^1=x^{\\frac{a}{a}}=(x^{\\frac{1}{a}})^a.\\] This means that raising \\(x^\\frac{1}{a}\\) to the power \\(a\\) gets us back to \\(x\\), hence the number \\(x^\\frac{1}{a}\\) is the \\(a^\\text{th}\\) root of \\(x\\). For example \\((3^\\frac{1}{2})^2=3^{2\\frac{1}{2}}=3^1=3\\), so we must have \\(3^\\frac{1}{2}=\\sqrt{3}\\). Theorem 1.3 (Rule 5) \\[x^{\\frac{1}{a}}=\\sqrt[a]{x}.\\] In particular the square root is \\(x^{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{x}\\) and the cube root is \\(x^{\\frac{1}{3}}=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\); we tend to use the root notation for expressions containing square or cube roots on their own, and use the power notation when combining different roots. It turns out that we can extend exponents beyond rational numbers to any real number, with all of the above rules still holding. Proving this is beyond the scope of these notes. Somethings missing: we said \\(x\\) can be any real number, but then how do we interpret something like \\(y=(-1)^\\frac{1}{2}\\)? That is, \\(y\\) must be a number such that when it is multiplied by itself it gives the negative number \\(-1\\), but this is impossible for a real number! Answering this conundrum requires us to invent a new set of numbers, called complex numbers  see section 5. A summary of the rules: Theorem 1.4 (Rules of Exponents) \\(x^ax^b=x^{a+b}\\) \\((x^a)^b=x^{ab}\\) \\(x^{-a}=\\frac{1}{x^a}\\) \\(x^0=1\\) \\(x^{\\frac{1}{a}}=\\sqrt[a]{x}.\\) 1.2.2 Brackets We use brackets to set the precedence (or order) of evaluating the different parts of an expression. We evaluate the innermost brackets first. Note we usually omit the multiplication sign when multiplying a bracketed expression. Example 1.2 (Evaluating brackets) \\[5(((2+4)\\div (5-2))+1)=5((6\\div 3)+1)=5(2+1)=5\\times 3 = 15\\] Sometimes you might find it helpful to add redundant brackets to make the calculation clearer. For example, we could write \\[3+2\\times 4=11\\] as \\[3+(2\\times 4)=11.\\] The brackets are not really needed in the second version since we get the same result from following BEDMAS, but adding brackets can make an expression easier to read and evaluate. 1.2.2.1 Expansion Recall that we can expand expressions involving multiplication of brackets such as the following: \\[a(b+c)=ab+ac\\] \\[(a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd\\] \\[(a+b)^2=(a+b)(a+b)=a^2+ab+ba+b^2=a^2+b^2+2ab\\] \\[(ab)^2=(ab)(ab)=a^2b^2.\\] We often want to expand expressions in order to simplify them by grouping together like-terms, for example: \\[(a+b)(b+c)+2ac=ab+ac+b^2+bc+2ac=ab+3ac+b^2+bc.\\] In the case of the sum of two numbers (a binomial term) to a postive integer power we have a general formula for the expansion, i.e. something of the form \\[(a+b)^n.\\] which involves multiplying out the brackets \\(n\\) times. We start by looking at a slightly simpler form \\[(1+x)^n.\\] Lets take a look at the expansion for the first few values of \\(n\\). \\(n=0:\\) \\((1+x)^0 = 1\\) \\(n=1:\\) \\((1+x)^1=1+x\\) \\(n=2:\\) \\((1+x)^2=(1+x)(1+x)=x^2+2x+1\\) \\(n=3:\\) \\((1+x)^3=(1+x)(1+x)^2=(1+x)(x^2+2x+1)=x^3+3x^2+3x+1\\) The coefficients of \\(x\\) form the \\(n^\\text{th}\\) row of Pascals triangle. The general formula is: \\[(1+x)^n = \\binom{n}{0}x^0+\\binom{n}{1}x^1+\\binom{n}{2}x^2+\\dotsb+\\binom{n}{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\binom{n}{n}x^n\\] where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient \\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\] and \\(n!\\) is the factorial of \\(n\\): \\[n!=n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times\\dotsb \\times3\\times 2\\times 1\\]. Given the more general form \\((a+b)^n\\), we can first extract a factor of \\(a\\) to give \\[(a+b)^n=(a(1+\\frac{b}{a}))^n=a^n(1+\\frac{b}{a})^n\\] so we now just need to evaluate \\((1+\\frac{b}{a})^n\\) using the formula and substituting \\(x\\) with \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\). Alternatively, the full formula is: \\[(x+y)^n = \\binom{n}{0}x^ny^0+\\binom{n}{1}x^{n-1}y^1+\\binom{n}{2}x^{n-2}y^2+\\dotsb+\\binom{n}{n-1}x^1y^{n-1}\\binom{n}{n}x^0y^n.\\] 1.2.2.2 Factorisation At other times, we wish to simplify by extracting common factors from an expression, which we call factorisation. In the simplest form, this could just be factorising a single number \\[2x+2y=2(x+y)\\] Or, it could involve extracting more complicated factors, for example \\[2xy+6x^2y=2xy(1+3x)\\] \\[x^2-3x-10=(x+2)(x-5)\\] The second example here is factorising a quadratic which we can do systematically by finding the roots  we will see how to do this later in section 2.1.3. 1.2.3 Simplifiying Expressions In order to simplify an expression we can carry out the following proceedures: Expand brackets Collect together any like-terms, e.g. \\(2a+3b+a=3a+3b\\), or \\(a^3a^2+b^2=a^5+b^2\\) Simplify any fractions: use common denominators, e.g. \\(\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d}=\\frac{da+bc}{bd}\\); cancel any common factors, e.g. \\(\\frac{ab}{ac}=\\frac{b}{c}\\) Factorise Note: these are rules of thumb, as there usually does not exist such a thing as a simplest form for a given algebraic expression. The meaning of simple is dependent on what we want to gain from it. The intention is to put the expression in a form that is easier to understand (in the given context) and which usually uses fewer symbols (but not always). Real numbers require quite a bit of work to define in a rigorous mathematical way and we will not do this here; the interested reader should look up construction of real numbers by Dedekind cuts or construction of real numbers by Cauchy sequences. We need to be more careful when \\(x=0\\), since we would have \\(\\frac{0^a}{0^a}=\\frac{0}{0}\\), which is an indeterminate form so the argument is not valid; it turns out \\(0^0\\) is also an indeterminate form. "],["equations-and-inequalities.html", "Chapter 2 Equations and Inequalities 2.1 Equations 2.2 Inequalities 2.3 Common mistakes!", " Chapter 2 Equations and Inequalities 2.1 Equations An equation indicates the equality of two mathematical expressions: what is on the left of the \\(=\\) sign is the same as what is on the right of the \\(=\\) sign. When manipulating equations, we must perform the same operation to each side in order to maintain equality  think about a traditional mechanical balance scale, where if we were to change the mass on one side of the balance we would need to do the same to the other side in order to maintain balance. We will use the abreviations l.h.s. for left-hand-side and r.h.s. for right-hand-side. There are a few subtly different types of equations; the main two are formulas and conditional equations. 2.1.1 Formulas Equations are often regarded as formulas, which can be used to calculate the value of a mathematical or physical quantity in terms of other known quantities. In this case, we write a single dependent variable on the left hand side and the right hand side will contain independent variables and constants. The value of the dependent variable depends on the values of the independent variables and is obtained by evaluating the right hand side when the values of the independent variables are known. For example, the formula for the area \\(A\\) of a circle is \\[A=\\pi r^2\\] where the independent variable \\(r\\) is the radius of the cirle and \\(\\pi\\) is the mathematical constant \\(3.141...\\). By plugging in a particular value for \\(r\\) we then obtain a value for the area \\(A\\). We often want to re-arrange equations to make a different variable the dependent variable, or subject, of the formula, i.e. to place it alone on the left hand-side. Re-arranging formulae is also known as transposition. For example, if we knew the area of a cirlce and wanted to calculate the corresponding radius, we can re-arrange the equation to make \\(r\\) the subject: \\[r=\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}}.\\] In obtaining this, we carry out the opposite of the operations on the right hand side to both sides of the equation. These opposites are: addition and subtraction; multiplication and division; powers and roots. Lets see this step by step in our example. We start with \\[A=\\pi r^2.\\] Then, divide both sides by \\(\\pi\\) \\[\\frac{A}{\\pi}=\\frac{\\pi}{\\pi}r^2=r^2\\] so that \\(r^2\\) is no longer multiplied by \\(\\pi\\). Now, to get from \\(r^2\\) to \\(r\\) we need to take the square root of both sides \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}}=\\sqrt{r^2}=r\\] and finally, we put the subject on the left hand side (since we read from left to right it is simply convention to do this, but mathematically it makes no difference since it is still an equality). 2.1.2 Conditional equations Another type of equation is a conditional equation. These may not hold true for all values of the variables and we will want to find the values for which equality is true. For example, \\[5x+4=19\\] is only true when \\(x=3\\). We can solve this equation by making \\(x\\) the subject: subract \\(4\\) from both sides \\[5x=15\\] divide both sides by \\(5\\) \\[x=3.\\] Note that an equation may have more than one solution, or perhaps no solutions. For example, \\[x^2=4\\] has two possible solutions, either \\(x=2\\) or \\(x=-2\\). On the other hand, the equation \\[x+2=x+3\\] has no solutions. To see this, subtract \\(x+2\\) from both sides and we obtain \\[0=1\\] which is false, so no value of \\(x\\) can give us equality. 2.1.3 Quadratic equations A particularly common form of equations that arise in science and engineering are quadratic equations. These are equations of the form \\[ax^2+bx+c=0\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants and we wish to find the values of \\(x\\) satisfying this equation. We explore three different methods below. 2.1.3.1 Factorisation by inspection First consider a quadratic where \\(a=1\\), that is \\[x^2+bx+c=0.\\] If we can write a quadratic equation as a product of two simple linear factors in the form3: \\[x^2+bx+c = (x+\\alpha)(x+\\beta)\\] then \\(x=-\\alpha\\) and \\(x=-\\beta\\) are solutions to \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\), since for \\(x=-\\alpha\\) \\[(-\\alpha+\\alpha)(-\\alpha+\\beta)=0(-\\alpha+\\beta)=0\\] and similarly for \\(x=-\\beta\\). Furthermore, these will be the only two solutions: it is possible there are two different solutions \\(\\alpha\\neq\\beta\\), one repeated solution where \\(\\alpha=\\beta\\) so that the quadratic factorises as \\((x+\\alpha)(x+\\alpha)=(x+\\alpha)^2\\), or there may be no solutions4. In many cases it is easy to spot the values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). To see this, lets work backwards and expand the brackets: \\[(x+\\alpha)(x+\\beta)=x^2+\\beta x +\\alpha x +\\alpha\\beta = x^2 + (\\alpha + \\beta)x + \\alpha\\beta\\] so we just need to find the values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) that sum to \\(b\\) and multiply together to give \\(c\\). Example 2.1 If we have \\[x^2+5x+6=0\\] we are looking for two numbers that sum to make \\(5\\) and multiply to make \\(6\\), so the answer is clearly \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=3\\), giving the factorisation \\[x^2+5x+6=(x+2)(x+3).\\] If we have a more general quadratic where \\(a\\neq1\\), then we could start by taking out a factor of \\(a\\) \\[ax^2+bx+c=a\\left(x^2+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}\\right)=0\\] and then dividing both sides by \\(a\\) \\[x^2+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}=0\\] The values of \\(x\\) satisfying this new equation will be the same as those for the original, so we can now use the above method to find the solutions. However, sometimes we not only want the solution, but also want to know how to factorise the quadratic. In this case we shall have to keep the factor of \\(a\\). To factorise we just need to find the values of the coefficients in the factorisation that will give the answer we need when we expand the brackets. Example 2.2 Solve \\(4x^2 + 8x + 3 = 0\\) by factorising. We need the \\(x\\) terms to multiply together to make \\(4x^2\\), so we could have either \\[(4x + \\star)(x + \\star)\\] or \\[(2x + \\star)(2x + \\star)\\] and we need the constant terms to multiply together to make \\(3\\), so we could have either \\[(\\star + 3)(\\star + 1)\\] or \\[(\\star - 3)(\\star - 1).\\] The sum of the products of the outer terms and inner terms needs to be \\(8x\\) and the only way this is possible is with \\[(2x+3)(2x+1).\\] The solutions then come from solving for each factor being \\(0\\), giving \\[x=-\\frac{3}{2}\\quad\\text{ or }\\quad x= -\\frac{1}{2}\\] Not all quadratics will factorise nicely, that is to say, where the coefficients in the linear factors will be integers. We can first test if the quadratic will factorise with integer coefficients by computing the quantity \\[\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\] which is known as the discriminant of a quadratic: if this number is a perfect square, then the linear factors will have integer coefficients; if it is not a perfect square, the coefficients will not be integers. In the case where the coefficients are not integers it can be difficult to determine the coefficients by inspection and the following two methods can be applied instead. 2.1.3.2 Completing the square In this method, we first rewrite a quadratic equation \\[ax^2+bx+c=0\\] into the form \\[a(x-h)^2+k=0\\] that is, a squared term plus a constant, hence the name completing the square. We then solve by rearranging and taking sqaure roots \\[\\begin{align*} (x-h)^2+k&amp;=0\\\\ (x-h)^2&amp;=-k\\\\ x-h&amp;=\\pm\\sqrt{-k}\\\\ x&amp;=h\\pm\\sqrt{-k} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\pm\\) means there is one solution coming from taking the \\(+\\) option and the other from taking the \\(-\\) option. We just need to find \\(h\\) and \\(k\\). They are given by \\[h=-\\frac{b}{2a},\\quad k=c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}.\\] It is not necessary to remember these formulae, we can instead figure out the coefficients as we go along. Example 2.3 (Completing the Square) Consider the quadratic equation \\[2x^2+12x-26=0.\\] We first take out the factor \\(a=2\\) \\[2x^2+12x-26=2(x^2+6x-13)\\] Next we can make a square term that agrees with the first two terms by taking half the \\(x\\) coefficient (i.e. \\(6\\div2=3\\)): \\[(x+3)^2=x^2+6x+9.\\] This differs from the required result in the constant term by \\[-13-9=-22\\] and so we need to complete the square by adding \\(-22\\), to obtain \\[2x^2+6x+13=2[(x+3)^2-22]=2(x+3)^2-44.\\] The solutions are then \\[\\begin{align*} 2(x+3)^2-44&amp;=0\\\\ 2(x+3)^2&amp;=44\\\\ (x+3)^2&amp;=22\\\\ x&amp;=-3\\pm\\sqrt{22}. \\end{align*}\\] 2.1.3.3 The quadratic formula Sometimes it is difficult to find the solutions using the above methods and so thankfully we have a forumula for finding them (or to determine if there are no real number solutions). Theorem 2.1 (Quadratic Formula) The solutions to the quadratic equation \\[ax^2+bx+c=0\\] are given by \\[x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\\] If the quantity \\(\\Delta = b^2-4ac\\), known as the discriminant, is such that \\(\\Delta = 0\\) then there will be one repeated solution; if \\(\\Delta\\) is negative, then there are no real number solutions (since we cannot take the square root of a negative number). Exercise 2.1 Derive the quadratic formula. Hint: use the method of completing the square on a general quadratic equation. 2.1.4 Simultaneous equations Sometimes a problem will be formulated in terms of multiple equations with multiple, shared variables. The set of equations usually represent constraints between the variables and we need to determine which values of the variables are valid solutions, i.e. which values satisfy all of the equations simultaneously  hence such sets of equations are known as simultaneous equations. Sometimes we can solve simultaneous equations by rearranging one equation to set one of the variables as the subject and then substitute this into another equation in order to eliminate one of the variables. Example 2.4 Given the following two simultaneous equations in the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+2y&amp;=5\\\\ x-4y&amp;=1 \\end{align*}\\] we could rearrange the second equation to make \\(x\\) the subject \\[x=1+4y\\] and then substitute this back in for \\(x\\) in the first equation \\[3(1+4y)+2y=5\\] and then solve for \\(y\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 3(1+4y)+2y&amp;=5\\\\ 3+12y+2y&amp;=5\\\\ 14y&amp;=2\\\\ y&amp;=\\frac{1}{7}. \\end{align*}\\] Now that we have the value for \\(y\\) we can substitute this back into either equation to find \\(x\\). Since we already rearranged the second equation to make \\(x\\) the subject, we might as well use that one: \\[x=1+4y=1+\\frac{4}{7}=\\frac{11}{7}.\\] Hence the solution is \\[x=\\frac{11}{7},\\quad y=\\frac{1}{7}.\\] The above example shows a particular type of simultaneous equations called linear simultaneous equations (if we were to plot a graph of each of the equations we would see that they form straight lines, hence the term linear). We shall look at a systematic way to deal with linear simultaneous equations in section ??. Example 2.5 Given the following two simultaneous equations in the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 2x+y&amp;=7\\\\ x^2-xy&amp;=6 \\end{align*}\\] it will be easiest to rearrange the first equation for \\(y\\), to get \\[y=7-2x\\] and then substituting this into the second equation \\[\\begin{align*} x^2-x(7-2x)&amp;=6\\\\ 3x^2-7x-6&amp;=0\\\\ (3x+2)(x-3)&amp;=0\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] so the factorisation tells us \\[x=-\\frac{2}{3},\\text{ or } x = 3.\\] Now substiting these two possibilities back into the first equation gives \\[\\begin{align*} 2(-\\frac{2}{3})+y&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=\\frac{25}{3} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} 2(3)+y&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=1. \\end{align*}\\] To summarise, the solutions are: \\[x = -\\frac{2}{3},\\quad y = \\frac{25}{3}\\] and \\[x=3,\\quad y=1.\\] The examples presented above are relatively simple, and in some real-world scenarios equations might be very complicated, or even impossible, to solve by hand. In these cases we need to turn to computational techniques. Well look at some computational techniques in section ??. 2.2 Inequalities We are familiar with the symbols \\(&lt;, \\leq, &gt;\\) and \\(\\geq\\), (less than, less than or equal to, greater than and greater than or equal to) which are used to define inequalities. Example 2.6 \\[x&lt;5\\] denotes all numbers that are strictly less that \\(5\\) (so not including \\(5\\) itself). \\[-1&lt; x \\leq 1\\] denotes all numbers that are strictly greater than \\(-1\\) but less that or equal to \\(1\\) (so \\(x=1\\) is a possibility). When solving inequalities (i.e. finding values of \\(x\\) which satisfy the expression) we need to be a bit more careful with their manipulation than with equalities. If we perform the same operation to both sides in an equality then the equality still holds true, but this is not the case in general for inequalities  in particular we need to be careful with multiplication by negative numbers which flips the inequality. Let \\(a,u,v,x,y,z\\) be real numbers, then some basic relations that hold true are: if \\(x&gt;y\\) and \\(y&gt;z\\), then \\(x&gt;z\\); if \\(x&gt;y\\), then \\(x+z&gt;y+z\\) and \\(x-z&gt;y-z\\); if \\(x&gt;y\\) and \\(u&gt;v\\), then \\(x+u&gt;y+v\\); if \\(x&gt;y\\), then \\(ax&gt;ay\\) if \\(a&gt;0\\), and \\(ax &lt; ay\\) if \\(a&lt;0\\); if \\(x&gt;y\\), then \\(\\dfrac{x}{a}&gt;\\dfrac{y}{a}\\) if \\(a&gt;0\\), and \\(\\dfrac{x}{a}&lt;\\dfrac{y}{a}\\) if \\(a&lt;0\\); if \\(x&gt;y&gt;0\\) and \\(u&gt;v&gt;0\\), then \\(xu&gt;yv\\) and \\(\\dfrac{x}{v}&gt;\\dfrac{y}{u}\\); if \\(x&gt;y&gt;0\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{x}&lt;\\dfrac{1}{y}\\). It should not be necessary to memorise all of these, it just requires a little thought when manipulating inequalities: the important ones to be careful with are multiplying or dividing by negative values. Assume we are comparing two expressions \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) that depend on the variable \\(x\\) and need to find, for example, the values of \\(x\\) for which \\(P&gt;Q\\). Let us take a look at a range of examples to see how to solve these types of problems. Example 2.7 We wish to find all values of \\(x\\) satisfying the following inequalities. \\(2x+6&lt;18.\\) Here we can easily re-arrange the inequality (subtract \\(6\\) from each side and divide by the positive number \\(2\\)  which preserves the direction of the inequality) to obtain \\[x&lt;6.\\] \\(x^2-7x+12&gt;0\\) Factorise the l.h.s. to give \\((x-3)(x-4)&gt;0\\), so to be positive the factors on the left need to be either both positive or both negative, i.e.: \\((x-3)&gt;0\\) and \\((x-4)&gt;0\\), so we must have both \\(x&gt;4\\) and \\(x&gt;3\\), which means that we must take \\(x&gt;4\\). \\((x-3)&lt;0\\) and \\((x-4)&lt;0\\), so we require both \\(x&lt;3\\) and \\(x&lt;4\\), which means we must take \\(x&lt;3\\). Since either situation a or b satisfies the inequality the solution is \\(x&lt;3\\) or \\(x&gt;4\\). \\(\\left|10-3x\\right|\\leq 8\\), where \\(|\\cdot|\\) denotes the absolute value. We must have both: \\[\\begin{align*} 10-3x&amp;\\leq 8\\\\ -3x&amp;\\leq-2\\\\ x&amp;\\geq \\frac{2}{3} \\end{align*}\\] i.e. the interval \\(x\\geq\\dfrac{2}{3}.\\) And, \\(-(10-3x)\\leq 8\\), leading to \\(x\\leq 6\\). Hence \\(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\leq x \\leq 6\\). \\(\\dfrac{1}{x-3}&gt;\\dfrac{1}{x-2}\\) Lets first do this the wrong way to illustrate a point. Lets multiply both sides by \\((x-2)\\) to obtain \\[\\begin{gather*} \\frac{x-2}{x-3}&gt;1\\\\ \\frac{x-2}{x-3}-1&gt;0\\\\ \\frac{(x-2)-(x-3)}{x-3}=\\frac{1}{x-3}&gt;0 \\end{gather*}\\] giving the solution \\(x&gt;3\\). We can check the solution graphically by plotting the l.h.s. and r.h.s. and seeing where the l.h.s. is greater than the r.h.s. Figure 2.1: A plot of the inequality \\(\\frac{1}{x-3}&gt;\\frac{1}{x-2}\\): the solid red line is the l.h.s and the dashed blue line is the r.h.s.. We are interested in finding the values of \\(x\\) where the red line is above the blue line (the red-shaded region). [Open graph in browser.] It would appear that something has gone wrong! There is a second interval \\(x&lt;2\\) where the inequality holds true. The problem is that we multiplied by the factor \\((x-2)\\) forgetting the fact that \\(x\\) is a variable, so this factor could be positive or negative depending on the value of \\(x\\) and hence can flip the inequality. We could still perform this multiplication so long as we keep track of the two possible cases when \\((x-2)\\) is positive or negative. However, a safer strategy is to first subtract the r.h.s. from the l.h.s., then factorise as much as possible: \\[\\frac{1}{x-3}-\\frac{1}{x-2}=\\frac{(x-2)-(x-3)}{(x-3)(x-2)}=\\frac{1}{(x-3)(x-2)}&gt;0.\\] Hence for the denominator to be positive we must have either \\(x&gt;3\\) and \\(x&gt;2\\), or \\(x&lt;3\\) and \\(x&lt;2\\). Together these yield the solution \\(x&lt;2\\) or \\(x&gt;3\\). The general strategy for finding \\(P&gt;Q\\) (or similar) is therefore: (1) Consider \\(P-Q\\) and factorise as much as possible; (2) Determine the sign of each factor of \\(P-Q\\) for varying \\(x\\); (3) Determine when \\(P-Q&gt;0\\) (and hence when \\(P&gt;Q\\)). 2.3 Common mistakes! We finish this section with some common algebraic errors to watch out for! Invent your own examples to convince yourself that these things are true. Fractions: \\(\\frac{a}{b+c}\\neq \\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{a}{c}\\) and \\(\\frac{a+b}{c+b}\\neq\\frac{a}{c}\\) (cant cancel the \\(b\\)s.). Inequalities: \\(ab&gt;c\\) does not imply that \\(a&gt;\\frac{c}{b}\\) (what happens if \\(b\\) is negative?). Powers: \\((a+b)^2\\neq a^2+b^2\\). Roots: \\(\\sqrt{a+b}\\neq \\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}\\). In fact, any quadratic can be factorised as a product of two linear factors, but we may need complex numbers to do this; more on this in section 5. That is, no solutions for which \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are real numbers, but there will instead be complex number solutions. "],["functions-and-graphs.html", "Chapter 3 Functions and Graphs 3.1 Lines 3.2 Polynomials 3.3 Rational functions 3.4 Root functions 3.5 Trigonometric functions 3.6 Exponentials and logarithms 3.7 Hyperbolic functions", " Chapter 3 Functions and Graphs A function \\(f\\) can be thought of as a machine that takes an input value \\(x\\) and returns an output value \\(y\\). The output value \\(y\\) corresponding to the input \\(x\\) is also denoted by \\(f(x)\\) (read \\(f\\) of \\(x\\)). We most commonly encounter functions whose input is a real number and output is a real number, but there are many other types of functions in mathematics. We are familiar with plotting such functions on a graph, where we draw the coordinates \\((x,f(x))\\), or \\((x,y)\\), against perpendicular axes  this is known as the Cartesian coordinate system. In this section we shall take a look at some useful functions, their graphs, and some of their other interesting properties. 3.1 Lines Consider the set of coordinates \\((x,y)\\) that satisfy the equation \\[ax+by+c=0\\] for some fixed values \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\). When \\(b\\neq0\\), solving the equation gives \\(y=-\\dfrac{a}{b}x-\\dfrac{c}{b}\\), which is of the form \\[y=mx+d\\] i.e. it is a straight line with gradient \\(m\\) which intercepts the \\(y\\)-axis at the value \\(d\\). On the other hand, when \\(b=0\\) we have the solution \\(x=-\\dfrac{c}{a}\\). This is a straight vertical line; lets set the constant \\(A=-\\dfrac{c}{a}\\), then it is all of the coordinates where \\(x=A\\), and since this equation does not depend on \\(y\\) it includes all possible \\(y\\) values. Note that we cannot write such a line in the form \\(y=mx+d\\), since it effectively has an infinite gradient. We can also have horizontal lines. This corresponds to an equation of the form \\(y=B\\) (this happens when \\(a=0\\) and where we have set \\(B=-\\dfrac{c}{b}\\)), so that \\(y\\) does not depend on \\(x\\) and equals the constant value \\(B\\) for all possible values of \\(x\\). Figure 3.1: A general line \\(ax+by+c=0\\) (red line) a line specified by a gradient and intercept \\(y=mx+d\\) (blue line), a vertical line \\(x=A\\) (green line) and a horizontal line \\(y=B\\) (orange line). Adjust the sliders to change the constants and check which values of \\(m,d,A,\\) and \\(B\\) correspond to \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\). [Open graph in browser.] Specifying a single point \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and a gradient \\(m\\) is enough to define a (non-vertical) line and we can write the equation of this line as \\[ y-y_1=m(x-x_1). \\] Also, a line can be defined by specifying any two points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) that lie on the line. We can calculate the gradient of this line from \\[ m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \\] but there is a problem if \\(x_2=x_1\\) and we have an infinite gradient  since \\(x_1=x_2\\) this, of course, corresponds to a vertical line, which we can write as the equation \\(x=x_1\\). The form \\(ax+by+c=0\\) is a general way to express any line in the plane and includes both vertical and non-vertical lines. The \\(y=mx+d\\) form is useful when thinking about non-vertical lines as we can easily identify the gradient and intercept. In section ?? we will be using the more general form for solving simultaneous linear equations. 3.1.1 Parallel lines A line makes an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the positive \\(x\\)-axis, the angle of inclination. This is related to the gradient \\(m\\) by \\[ m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=\\tan(\\theta). \\] Two lines are parallel if they have the same angle of inclination \\(\\theta\\), or same gradient \\(m\\). Figure 3.2: The angle of inclination of a line. Hence if two (non-vertical) lines are parallel they are of the form \\[\\begin{align*} y&amp;=mx + d_1\\\\ y&amp;=mx + d_2 \\end{align*}\\] 3.1.2 Perpendicular lines Two lines are perpendicular, or normal, if they meet at a right angle. We have \\[\\begin{align*} m_1&amp;=\\tan(\\theta)\\quad\\text{and,}\\\\ m_2&amp;=\\tan\\Big(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\Big)=\\frac{\\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2})}{\\cos(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})}{\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) - \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{\\cos(\\theta)}{-\\sin(\\theta)}\\\\ &amp;=-\\cot(\\theta) \\end{align*}\\] Figure 3.3: Perpendicular lines. Thus, two (non-vertical) lines are perpendicular if \\[\\begin{equation*} m_1m_2=-1 \\end{equation*}\\] and hence they have the forms \\[\\begin{align*} y&amp;=mx + d_1,\\\\ y&amp;=-\\frac{1}{m}x + d_2. \\end{align*}\\] Alternatively, if we describe a line by \\(ax+by+c=0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} ax+by+p&amp;=0\\quad\\text{is a parallel line}\\\\ bx+ay+q&amp;=0\\quad\\text{is a perpendicular line} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are constants. [Exercise: Verify this last statement.] 3.2 Polynomials A polynomial is a function made up of non-negative integer powers of the independent variable \\(x\\) multiplied by constant coefficients, i.e. it has the form \\[f(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\dotsb + a_n x^n\\] where the fixed numbers \\(a_0,\\dots,a_n\\) are the coefficients (which could be positive, negative or zero). For example, the following are all polynomials: \\[\\begin{align*}f(x)&amp;=x^2\\\\ g(x)&amp;=2+\\frac{1}{3}x^4 - x^5\\\\ h(x)&amp;=-3.6 + x^2 -2x^10 \\end{align*}\\] The number \\(n\\) corresponding to the highest power in the polynomial is called the order or degree of the polynomial. For the functions \\(f, g\\) and \\(h\\) above the degrees are \\(2, 5\\) and \\(10\\). We have a few special names for polynomials of low degree: Degree 1: a linear polynomial, since its graph is a line Degree 2: a quadratic polynomial Degree 3: a cubic polynomial Degree 4: a quartic polynomial Degree 5: a quintic polynomial The higher the degree of the polynomial, the more wavey its graph can be; in fact, a degree \\(n\\) polynomial can have at most \\(n-1\\) turning points. A polynomial which has only one term is called a monomial, for example \\[f(x)=2\\\\ g(x)=3x^2\\\\ h(x)=-4x^5 \\] are all monomials. Figure 3.4: A plot of a polynomial of at most degree 5, \\(f(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5\\). Adjust the sliders to change the coefficients \\(a_0\\) to \\(a_5\\) to get a feel for the possible shapes of a degree 5 polynomial; set the higher degree coefficients to \\(0\\) to look at lower degree polynomials; also take a look at the monomials up to degree 5. [Open graph in browser.] We are often interested in finding the values of \\(x\\) for which \\(f(x)=0\\), known as the roots of a polynomial. We already know how to find roots of a quadratic using the quadratic formula (section 2.1.3). We will now look at the more general factor theorem that can help in finding roots of higher degree polynomials. If we factorise the quadratic equation \\[x^2-3x-10=0\\] we obtain \\[(x+2)(x-5)=0.\\] If the product of two numbers is zero, then either one or both of the numbers must be zero. So the possible roots are \\[(x+2)=0 \\quad \\implies\\quad x=-2\\] or \\[(x-5)=0\\quad \\implies\\quad x=5.\\] More generally, a factor \\((x-a)\\) corresponds to a root \\(x=a\\). Knowing the factors tells us the roots, and vice versa. It turns out this holds more generally for any degree polynomial. Theorem 3.1 (Factor Theorem) The value \\(x=a\\) is a root of the polynomial equation \\(f(x)=0\\) if and only if \\((x-a)\\) is a factor of the polynomial \\(f(x)\\). We already have a fool-proof way to solve quadratic equations  use the quadratic formula. There are also formulae for cubic and quartic polynomials, but these are a bit more complicated. Furthermore, it turns out it is impossible to derive a formula for quintic and higher degree polynomials! The factor theorem can be helpful in finding roots of polynomials greater than degree 2. Here is an example. Example 3.1 (Factor theorem applied to a cubic polynomial) Find the roots of the cubic polynomial \\[f(x)=x^3-7x-6.\\] After a little trial and error with small integer values of \\(x\\) we find \\[f(3)=3^3-7(3)-6=0\\] which by the factor theorem implies that \\((x-3)\\) is a factor. Now applying polynomial division by the factor \\((x-3)\\) we find \\[\\frac{x^3-7x-6}{x-3}=x^2+3x+2\\] so that \\[x^3-7x-6=(x-3)(x^2+3x+2).\\] Now that we have taken out one linear factor we are left with a quadratic factor, which we know how to deal with. Factorising the quadratic factor yields \\[x^3-7x-6=(x-3)(x+1)(x+2).\\] Hence the roots are \\[x=3, x=-1,\\,\\text{ and } x=-2.\\] 3.3 Rational functions A rational function is one that can be expressed as the quotient of two polynomials, for example \\[f(x)=\\frac{1+x}{2-x+3x^2}\\] is the quotient of a degree 1 polynomial and a degree 2 polynomial. They often have values of \\(x\\) where they are undefined due to the denominator evaluating to zero. Furthermore, they often have asymptotes, which means the graph approaches a straight line. For example, the function \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}-4}\\) has asmptotes at the vertical lines \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=-2\\) and at the horizontal line \\(y=1\\). Figure 3.5: A plot of the rational function \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}-4}\\) (solid red line) and its asymptotes (dashed blue lines). [Open graph in browser.] 3.4 Root functions Taking the \\(n^\\text{th}\\) root of a number \\(\\sqrt[n]{x}\\) returns the answer to the question what number multiplied by itself \\(n\\) times equals \\(x\\)?. We saw in section 1.2.1 that this is the same as taking the power \\(x^\\frac{1}{n}\\). Taking the \\(n^\\text{th}\\) root can also be thought of as reversing the operation of taking the \\(n^\\text{th}\\) power (and vice versa). In this sense, the functions \\(f(x)=x^n\\) and \\(g(x)=\\sqrt[n]{x}\\) are inverse functions  they each undo the action of the other to return to the original value \\(x\\). If we first apply \\(f\\) and then \\(g\\) (known as the composition of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\)), or the other way around, then the result is to get back to \\(x\\): \\[g(f(x)) = \\sqrt[n]{x^n}=x\\] and \\[f(g(x)) = (\\sqrt[n]{x})^n=x.\\] Note that when \\(n\\) is even the root function only makes sense for positive values of \\(x\\), whilst if \\(n\\) is an odd number then it also makes sense for negative values of \\(x\\) (Why? Think about this!). Graphically, the inverse of a function is the reflection in the line \\(y=x\\) (Why?). Figure 3.6: The functions \\(f(x)=x^2\\) (red line) \\(g(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) (blue) are reflections of each other in the line \\(y=x\\) (dashed black). [Open graph in browser.] 3.5 Trigonometric functions The three basic trigonometric functions are sine (\\(\\sin\\)), cosine (\\(\\cos\\)) and tangent (\\(\\tan\\)), which we are familiar with from trigonometry for calculations involving angles. We shall explore trigonometry in more detail in section 4. For now, we will just look at some of their properties as functions. Sine and cosine look similar, like waves, with one graph shifted along the \\(x\\) axis from the other. They oscillate between their maximum value of \\(1\\) and minimum value of \\(-1\\). Figure 3.7: The functions \\(\\sin(x)\\) (red curve) and \\(\\cos(x)\\) (blue dashed line). [Open graph in browser.] In figure 3.7 we have plotted the functions with the \\(x\\) axis in units of radians. This is the natural mathematical choice of units, but in applications we tend to use degrees. Well understand more about radians and see how these units are related to degrees in section 4. Note the graphs repeat every \\(2\\pi\\) radians  they are periodic functions with period \\(2\\pi\\). The tangent function is defined via sine and cosine as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] Its graph looks rather different to sine and cosine. Figure 3.8: The function \\(\\tan(x)\\) (green curve). [Open graph in browser.] Like sine and cosine it is periodic, with period \\(\\pi\\). It is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) (and repeatedly every \\(2\\pi\\)) since at this value \\(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2})=0\\) so we have division by zero. Close to these points, where we are dividing by a very small value of \\(\\cos\\), it takes arbitrarily large positive and negative values and we have a vertical asymptote. Close to these points, the value of \\(\\cos(x)\\) in the denominator of (3.1) is very small, whilst the value of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is close to \\(1\\) or \\(-1\\), which results in very large positive or negative values of \\(\\tan(x)\\) and we have vertical asymptotes at these points. 3.6 Exponentials and logarithms An exponential function is one of the form \\[ f(x)=a^x \\] where the positive number \\(a\\) is called the . Figure 3.9: The function \\(f(x)=a^x\\) for varying positive values of \\(a\\). [Open graph in browser.] The term exponential growth corresponds to such functions; this is where the instantaneous rate of change of a quantity is proportional to its current magnitude and this is the characteristic property of exponential functions. More mathematically, the instantaneous rate of change is given by the derivative5, so we have \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{d(a^x)}{dx}=ka^x \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(k\\) is the constant of proportionality6 (which we shall find in section ??). Exponential growth is a common occurance in physical systems, at least in the early stages of a process. For example, it can describe the early stages of population growth well, when there are no limits on resources and a constant birth rate; in reality, limits (on food, space, impact of disease etc.) mean that uncurbed exponential growth cannot take place forever. Any exponential function with any base \\(a&gt;1\\) will grow faster than any polynomial; although a polynomial can be larger for some small range of \\(x\\) values, eventually the exponential graph will overtake the polynomial. Figure 3.10: The functions \\(f(x)=a^x\\) for varying \\(a&gt;1\\) (red curve) and the monomial \\(g(x)=x^n\\) for varying power \\(n\\) (blue dashed curve); for any value of \\(a\\) and any value of \\(n\\), if you scroll up far enough you will see that the red curve overtakes the dashed blue curve. [Open graph in browser.] There is a special value of the base \\(a\\) for which the constant of proportionality is \\(k=1\\). This is known as Eulers number and is denoted as \\(e\\). It is an irrational number (has an infinite, never repeating decimal expansion): \\[e=2.71828182846...\\] The function \\(e^x\\) is referred to as the natural exponential function or just the exponential function. It is also commonly denoted by \\(\\exp(x)\\). Since by definition \\(k=1\\) we have: \\[\\frac{de^x}{dx}=1e^x=e^x.\\] The inverse of an exponential function \\(f(x)=a^x\\) is called the logarithm to the base \\(a\\), denoted by \\(\\log_a(x)\\). Since it is the inverse, the exponential and logarithm undo the action of each other, so that \\[\\log_a(a^x)=x\\] and \\[a^{\\log_a(x)}=x\\]. For the base \\(a=e\\), we call the logarithm \\(\\log_e(x)\\) the natural logarithm and use the notation \\[\\ln(x)=\\log_e(x)\\] \\(\\ln(x)\\) is usually spoken as lun x or L.N. of x. Figure 3.11: The functions \\(f(x)=a^x\\) for varying \\(a&gt;1\\) (red curve) and the inverse \\(g(x)=\\log_a(x)\\) (blue curve) together with the line \\(y=x\\) to show the symmetry of the function and its inverse. [Open graph in browser.] In engineering applications it is also common to use base \\(2\\) and base \\(10\\). For base \\(10\\), the following notation is sometimes used \\[\\log(x)=\\log_{10}(x)\\] but we should always check what the author intends as sometimes \\(\\log(x)\\) is used to mean \\(\\ln(x)\\). We have the following rules for manipulating logarithms (these follow from the laws of exponents; try to derive them yourself): Theorem 3.2 (Rules of Logarithms) \\(\\log_a(xy)=\\log_a(x)+\\log_a(y)\\) \\(\\log_a(x^p)=p\\log_a(x)\\) \\(\\log_a(\\frac{x}{y})=\\log_a(x)-\\log_a(y)\\) \\(\\log_a(1)=0\\) \\(\\log_a(a)=1\\) We can also change between bases in logarithms with the following rule Theorem 3.3 (Change of Base Rule) Let \\(y=a^x\\), then \\(x=\\log_a(y)\\). Also, \\(\\log_b(y)=x\\log_b(a)\\), and so \\(x=\\dfrac{\\log_b(y)}{\\log_b(a)}\\). Therefore, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\log_a(y)=\\dfrac{\\log_b (y)}{\\log_b (a)}. \\end{equation*}\\] This allows us to calculate \\(\\log_a\\) of a number in terms of \\(\\log_b\\). An exponential function with base \\(a\\) can be re-written in any other base \\(b\\) with a constant factor in the argument as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} a^x&amp;=b^{\\log_b (a^x)} \\quad \\text{(note that $b^{\\log_b y}=y$)} \\\\ &amp;=b^{x\\log_b (a)}\\\\ &amp;=b^{kx},\\quad \\text{where }k=\\log_b(a). \\end{align*}\\] The natural choice of base for mathematical use is \\(b=e\\) and hence we usually only consider exponential functions in the form \\(e^{kx}\\) where \\(k=\\ln(a)\\). 3.6.1 Logarthmic plots When we have quatities that change over a large range of magnitudes, it can be more convenient to plot them on a logarthmic scale so that they do not take up so much space on the page. For example, the Ricther Magnitude Scale for measuring earthquakes is a logarthmic scale, which takes the logarithm to the base 10 of the amplitude of waves recorded by seismographs. The following is a semi-log plot, where the \\(y\\)-axis is the logarithmic scale and the \\(x\\)-axis is a (normal) linear scale. This means that every unit moved up along the \\(y\\)-axis actually represents a power of 10 increase in the amplitude of the seismograph waves. Figure 3.12: Magnitude of the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake (red dot) and aftershocks (which continued to occur after the period shown here). From Wikipedia - Phoenix7777. The logarithmic nature of the scale is sometimes made clearer by labelling the axis with an exponentially increasing scale and drawing in the minor gridlines. In figure 3.13 the major grid lines on the \\(y\\)-axis increase by a power of \\(10\\). The minor grid lines between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\) represent increments of \\(1\\) unit, then the minor grid lines between \\(10\\) and \\(10^2=100\\) represent increments of \\(10\\) units, and so on. Figure 3.13: Semi log graph paper (base 10). From wikimedia. 3.7 Hyperbolic functions The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the exponential function. They are named after the trigonometric functions due to possessing some similar properties, although their graphs are quite different. Hyperbolic sine, usually spoken as shine is defined as \\[\\sinh(x)=\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}\\] Hyperbolic cosine or cosh is defined as \\[\\cosh(x)=\\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}\\] Hyperbolic tangent or tanch is defined as \\[{\\tanh(x)=\\dfrac{\\sinh(x)}{\\cosh(x)}=\\dfrac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}}\\] Figure 3.14: The functions \\(\\sinh(x)\\) (red curve), \\(\\cosh(x)\\) (blue curve) and \\(\\tanh(x)\\) (green curve). [Open graph in browser.] The usual trigonometric identities also hold for the corresponding hyperbolic functions, except that where ever there is a \\(\\sin^2\\) we replace it with a \\(-\\sinh^2\\). For example: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\text{Trigonometric} &amp;\\text{Hyperbolic}\\\\ &amp;\\sin^2(x)+\\cos^2(x)=1 &amp;\\cosh^2(x)-\\sinh^2(x)=1 \\\\ &amp;\\sin(2x)=2\\sin(x)\\cos(x) &amp;\\sinh(2x)=2\\sinh(x)\\cosh(x) \\\\ &amp;\\cos(2x)=\\cos^2(x)-\\sin^2(x) &amp;\\cosh(2x)=\\cosh^2(x)+\\sinh^2(x) \\\\ &amp;1+\\tan^2(x)=\\sec^2(x) &amp;1-\\tanh^2(x)=\\text{sech}^2(x) \\end{align*}\\] As an example of where these functions arise in the real-world, the shape formed by a flexible cable or chain hanging from its ends under its own weight has the general form \\[\\begin{equation*} y=a\\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] and is known as a catenary curve.

The phrase exponential growth is sometimes used in a casual way to talk about anything that increases quickly, but mathematicians, scientists and engineers are more precise and would only use the term in its strict mathematical sense, as relating to an exponential function! "],["trigonometry.html", "Chapter 4 Trigonometry 4.1 Pythagoras 4.2 Degrees and radians 4.3 Trigonometric ratios 4.4 Sine and cosine rules 4.5 Trigonometric waveforms 4.6 Trigonometric identities", " Chapter 4 Trigonometry 4.1 Pythagoras The most fundamental result in trigonometry is the Pythagorean Theorem: Theorem 4.1 (Pythagorean Theorem) In a right-angle triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. In any right-angle triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. With reference to figure 4.1, we have \\[c^2=a^2+b^2\\] Figure 4.1: A right-angled triangle with sides \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), with \\(c\\) being the hypotenuse. One particular application is finding the distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system. 4.2 Degrees and radians We can measure an angle in two different units: degrees or radians. In degrees, we split a full circle into 360 segments and then call the angle bewteen each segment 1 degree, or \\(1^\\circ\\). Of course a full circle is \\(360^\\circ\\). An alternative measure of angle is radians. In this case, we start from the fact that the circumference of a circle is given by \\[ C=2\\pi r \\] where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle. If we had a circle with radius \\(r=1\\), then the circumference is \\(C=2\\pi\\). Now we consider this circle to be split into \\(2\\pi\\) segments7, with each segment being 1 radian, or \\(1 \\text{ rad}\\). A full circle is then \\(2\\pi \\text{ rad} = 6.283 \\text{ rad}\\) (to 3 sig. fig.). Sometimes it is more convenient to work in degrees, and other times it is more convenient to work in radians. We can easily convert between degrees and radians as follows. If we have an angle \\(D^\\circ\\) in degrees, then the corresponding angle in radians \\(R \\text{ rad}\\) is: \\[ R \\text{ rad}=\\frac{2\\pi}{360}\\times D^\\circ \\] and in the other direction \\[ D^\\circ=\\frac{360}{2\\pi}\\times R \\text{ rad}. \\] Where possible, we would state radians as multiples of \\(\\pi\\), so in particular: Degrees Radians \\(360^\\circ\\) \\(2\\pi\\text{ rad}\\) \\(270^\\circ\\) \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\pi\\text{ rad}\\) \\(180^\\circ\\) \\(\\pi\\text{ rad}\\) \\(120^\\circ\\) \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\text{ rad}\\) \\(90^\\circ\\) \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\text{ rad}\\) \\(60^\\circ\\) \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\text{ rad}\\) \\(45^\\circ\\) \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\text{ rad}\\) \\(30^\\circ\\) \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\text{ rad}\\) Note that a scientific calculator will have a button to switch between using degrees and radians: make sure your calculator is in the correct mode! 4.3 Trigonometric ratios Calculating angles and side lengths of right-angled triangles is of fundamental importance in science and engineering applications. Figure 4.2: A right-angled triangle. Recall that we can calculate relationships between angles and side lengths of a right-angled triangle (as described in figure 4.2) using sine, cosine and tangent: \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin(\\theta)&amp;=\\frac{Opp.}{Hyp.}\\\\ \\cos(\\theta)&amp;=\\frac{Adj.}{Hyp.}\\\\ \\tan(\\theta)&amp;=\\frac{Opp.}{Adj.} \\end{align*}\\] A useful way to remember these relationships is the mnemonic SOH CAH TOA: SOH - Sine equals Opposite over Hypotenuse CAH - Cosine equals Adjacent over Hypotenuse TOA - Tan equals Opposite over Adjacent These are most commonly used to determine angles by using the inverse functions: \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta&amp;=\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{Opp.}{Hyp.})\\\\ \\theta&amp;=\\cos^{-1}(\\frac{Adj.}{Hyp.})\\\\ \\theta&amp;=\\tan^{-1}(\\frac{Opp.}{Adj.}) \\end{align*}\\] WARNING: the notation suggests we are taking \\(\\sin\\) to the power \\(-1\\), so that \\(\\sin^{-1}=\\frac{1}{\\sin}\\), but this is NOT how the inverse is defined. Remember that the inverse undoes the action of the function. Scientific calculators will have buttons to apply these functions. The inverses are also sometimes called \\[\\begin{align*} \\arcsin&amp;=\\sin^{-1},\\\\ \\arccos&amp;=\\cos^{-1},\\\\ \\arctan&amp;=\\tan^{-1}. \\end{align*}\\] Example 4.1 (Applying inverse trig. functions) Calculate the angle \\(\\theta\\) in the following triangle. Figure 4.3: A right angled triangle with hypotenuse legth 14 units and adjacent length 8 units. Since we have the lengths of the hypotenuse and adjacent, we can use \\(\\cos^{-1}\\) to find \\(\\theta\\). Using a calculator we find \\[\\theta=\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{8}{14}\\right)=55.15^\\circ \\text{(to 2 d.p.)}\\] We also have special names for the reciprocal trigonometric functions: \\[\\begin{align*} \\operatorname{cosec}(\\theta)&amp;=\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\theta)},\\\\ \\sec(\\theta)&amp;=\\frac{1}{\\cos(\\theta)},\\\\ \\cot(\\theta)&amp;=\\frac{1}{\\tan(\\theta)}. \\end{align*}\\] 4.4 Sine and cosine rules The Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometric ratios above only apply to right-angle triangles. For general triangles, the sine and cosine rules give us useful relationsips between angles and side lengths. Figure 4.4: A general triangle with angles \\(A, B,\\) and \\(C\\) and the corresponding opposite sides as \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Theorem 4.2 (Sine Rule) Label a triangle with angles \\(A, B,\\) and \\(C\\) and the corresponding opposite sides as \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) (as in figure 4.4). Then, \\[\\frac{a}{\\sin(A)}=\\frac{b}{\\sin(B)}=\\frac{c}{\\sin(C)}.\\] This is useful when we have: one side and any two angles, or two sides and an angle (but not the included angle). Theorem 4.3 (Cosine Rule) Label a triangle with angles \\(A, B,\\) and \\(C\\) and the corresponding opposite sides as \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) (as in figure 4.4). Then, \\[\\begin{align*} a^2&amp;= b^2 +c^2 -2bc\\cos(A)\\quad\\text{ or,}\\\\ b^2&amp;=a^2+c^2-2ac\\cos(B)\\quad\\text{ or,}\\\\ c^2&amp;=a^2+b^2-2ab\\cos(C). \\end{align*}\\] This is useful when we have: two sides and the included angle, or three sides. 4.5 Trigonometric waveforms The trigonometric functions often arise in applications in the context of waves. Whilst there are different forms of waves, trigonometric waves are arguably the most ubiquitous. In general, a function of the form \\[ f(x)=A\\sin(\\omega x + \\phi) \\] with parameters \\(A,\\omega\\) and \\(\\phi\\) is known as a sinusoidal function. Figure 4.5: A sinusoidal wave form plotted in radians. \\(A\\) is called the amplitude  this determines the range of values, from \\(-A\\) to \\(A\\); \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency  the rate of change of the sine function argument in units of radians per second or degrees per second; \\(\\phi\\) is the phase  this determines the offset of the sine function at \\(x=0\\) in units of radians or degrees. \\(T=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\) is the length of one cycle e.g. measured from peak to peak, or trough to trough. If \\(x\\) represents time, then \\(T\\) is called the period. If \\(x\\) represents distance, then \\(T\\) is usually denoted by \\(\\lambda\\) and called the wavelength. Figure 4.6: The function \\(f(x)=A\\sin(\\omega x + \\phi)\\) (blue curve). [Open graph in browser.] A useful formula for combining \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\) waves is: \\[a\\cos(\\theta)+b\\sin(\\theta)=R\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)\\] where: \\(R=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\) \\(\\phi=\\tan^{-1}(b/a)\\) 4.6 Trigonometric identities Recall that there are a number of useful relationships between the trigonometric functions. Here are some key ones. 4.6.1 Pythagorean identities These follow from the Pythagorean theorem. \\[\\begin{gather*} \\sin^2(\\theta)+\\cos^2(\\theta)=1\\\\ 1+\\tan^2(\\theta)=\\sec^2(\\theta)\\\\ \\cot^2(\\theta)+1=\\operatorname{cosec}^2(\\theta) \\end{gather*}\\] 4.6.2 Compound angle formulae The following formulae allow us to manipulate sines, cosines and tangents of the sum or difference of two angles. \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin(\\theta+\\phi)&amp;=\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)+\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\\\ \\sin(\\theta-\\phi)&amp;=\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)-\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\\\ \\cos(\\theta+\\phi)&amp;=\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)-\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\\\ \\cos(\\theta-\\phi)&amp;=\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)+\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\\\ \\tan(\\theta+\\phi)&amp;=\\frac{\\tan(\\theta)+\\tan(\\phi)}{1-\\tan(\\theta)\\tan(\\phi)}\\\\ \\tan(\\theta-\\phi)&amp;=\\frac{\\tan(\\theta)-\\tan(\\phi)}{1+\\tan(\\theta)\\tan(\\phi)} \\end{align*}\\] 4.6.3 Double angle formulae Setting \\(\\phi=\\theta\\) in the compound angle formulae gives the following double angle formulae: \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin(2\\theta)&amp;=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\\\ \\cos(2\\theta)&amp;=\\cos^2(\\theta)-\\sin^2(\\theta)\\\\ \\tan(2\\theta)&amp;=\\frac{2\\tan(\\theta)}{1-\\tan^2(\\theta)} \\end{align*}\\] 4.6.4 Product to sum formulae From the compound angle formulae we can derive the following. \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)&amp;=\\frac{1}{2}[\\sin(\\theta+\\phi)+\\sin(\\theta-\\phi)]\\\\ \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)&amp;=\\frac{1}{2}[\\sin(\\theta+\\phi)-\\sin(\\theta-\\phi)]\\\\ \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)&amp;=\\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(\\theta+\\phi)+\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)]\\\\ \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)&amp;=-\\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(\\theta+\\phi)-\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)]\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] 4.6.5 Sum to product formulae In the other direction (also derived from the compound angle formulae) we have the following. \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin(\\theta)+\\sin(\\phi)=2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta+\\phi}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta-\\phi}{2}\\right)\\\\ \\sin(\\theta)-\\sin(\\phi)=2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta+\\phi}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta-\\phi}{2}\\right)\\\\ \\cos(\\theta)+\\cos(\\phi)=2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta+\\phi}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta-\\phi}{2}\\right)\\\\ \\cos(\\theta)-\\cos(\\phi)=-2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta+\\phi}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta-\\phi}{2}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note this is not an integer number of segments! It is approximately 6.283 segments.

We also know about irrational numbers such as \\(e\\), \\(\\pi\\) (the area of a circle with radius equal to \\(1\\)) or \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)  one solution of the quadratic equation \\[ x^2 - 2 = 0. \\] The collection of natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers make up what we call the real numbers, denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). But do we have enough numbers? The answer is no! We do not have to look hard for why we do not have enough numbers. The simple equation \\[ x^2 + 1 = 0 \\] does not have real solutions. The answer would be \\(\\pm \\sqrt{-1}\\), if that would make sense. More generally, the quadratic equation \\[ a x^2 + b x + c = 0, \\quad \\text{with}\\quad b^2 - 4 ac &lt; 0 \\] does not have real number solutions! 5.1 \\(i\\) and complex numbers Our fix is to define the imaginary number \\(i\\) by8 \\[ i = \\sqrt{-1},\\quad \\text{ so that }\\quad i^2 = -1. \\] With this definition in mind, consider the quadratic equation \\[ x^2 + 4 x + 13 = 0. \\] Completing the square gives \\[ (x+2)^2 + 9 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad x+2 = \\pm \\sqrt{-9} = \\pm 3 \\sqrt{-1} = \\pm 3 i \\quad \\implies \\quad x = -2 \\pm 3 i. \\] This leads us to Complex Numbers, denoted by \\(\\mathbb{C}\\), defined as the set of all numbers \\[ z = x + i y, \\quad \\text{where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers}. \\] This form is also called the Cartesian representation of a complex number. It has a real part \\(\\mathbf{Re}(z) = x\\) and an imaginary part \\(\\mathbf{Im}(z) = y\\). We can then represent a complex number graphically by plotting the real and imaginary parts as coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system, as in figure 5.1, known as the complex plane. The \\(x\\)-axis is called the real axis and the \\(y\\)-axis is called the imaginary axis. Figure 5.1: The complex number \\(z = x + iy\\) in Cartesian coordinates. Note that any real number \\(x\\) can also be considered as a complex number, since it is a complex number that happens to have \\(0\\) imaginary part: \\(x = x +0i\\); it is a complex number that lies on the real axis. We know from experience that a quadratic equation can have at most 2 roots. Once we have accepted complex numbers as part of our everyday lives, we see that they complete the picture of roots of polynomials. Theorem 5.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) Every non-zero, complex, single variable, degree \\(n\\) polynomial, has exactly \\(n\\) roots. To clarify the above theorem, we are talking about a polynomial of the form \\[f(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\dotsb + a_n x^n\\] where the variable \\(x\\) can be a complex number (so can also be a real number) and the coefficients \\(a_i\\) are complex numbers (so can also be real numbers) and at least one of these coefficients is not \\(0\\). Since we allow the single variable \\(x\\) to be a complex number, the roots may be complex numbers. Note that some of the \\(n\\) roots might be repeated roots, for example, according to the theorem the quadratic \\[x^2-4x+4=(x-2)(x-2)\\] must have two roots and in this case they happen to be repeated roots; we say the root is \\(x=2\\) with multiplicity 2. 5.2 Complex arithmetic We can add, subtract and multiply complex numbers \\(z = x+iy\\) and \\(w = u+iv\\), using usual algebraic rules for expanding brackets  just remembering that \\(i^2 = -1\\): \\[\\begin{align*} z + w &amp;= (x + iy) + (u + iv) = (x+u) + i (y+v),\\\\ z - w &amp;= (x + iy) - (u + iv) = (x-u) + i (y-v),\\\\ z \\times w &amp;= (x + iy) \\times (u + iv) = x u + i x v + i yu + i^2 y v = (xu - yv) + i (xv + yu). \\end{align*}\\] Example 5.1 (Complex Arithmetic) Let \\(z = 3 - 5i\\) (that is, \\(z = 3 + (-5)i\\)) and \\(w = 2 + i\\) then \\[ z + w = 5 - 4i, \\qquad z - w = 1 - 6i, \\] and \\[ z\\times w = (3 - 5i)\\times (2+i) = 6 + 3i - 10i - 5i^2 = 11 - 7i. \\] Thus \\(\\mathbf{Re}(z\\times w) = 11\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Im}(z\\times w) = -7\\). The complex conjugate of \\(z = x + iy\\) is the complex number \\[ \\overline{z} = x - iy. \\] This is the mirror image of \\(z\\) in the real axis. The modulus of \\(z = x + iy\\) is \\[ |z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\qquad \\text{(the non-negative square root).} \\] Geometrically, this is the distance of \\(z\\) (i.e. the point \\(P\\)) from the origin  See figure 5.1. Note that if \\(b = 0\\) (so that \\(z\\) is actually a real number), then this definition of \\(|z|\\) agrees with the usual modulus (absolute value) for real numbers. Example 5.2 (Complex conjugate) For \\(z = 2 - i\\), we have \\(\\overline{z} = 2 + i\\) and \\(|z| = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{5}\\). Some properties of modulus and conjugate: For any complex numbers \\(z, w\\), \\(\\overline{\\overline{z}} = z\\); \\(\\overline{z \\pm w} = \\overline{z} + \\overline{w}\\); \\(\\overline{z\\times w} = \\overline{z}\\times \\overline{w}\\); \\(|z|\\) is a positive real number unless \\(z = 0\\) with \\(|0| = 0\\); \\(z\\times \\overline{z} = |z|^2\\); \\(|z\\times w| = |z|\\,|w|\\). What about division of complex numbers? This is made easy using the complex conjugate as follows: \\[\\frac{z}{w}=\\frac{z}{w}\\frac{\\overline{w}}{\\overline{w}}=\\frac{z\\times \\overline{w}}{|w|^2}.\\] Example 5.3 (Complex division) Let \\(z = 2 + 3i\\) and \\(w = 4 - 2i\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{z}{w}&amp;=\\frac{2 + 3i}{4 - 2i}\\frac{4+2i}{4+2i}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{8+4i+12i+6i^2}{16+4}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{2+16i}{20}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{4}{5}i \\end{align*}\\] A useful fact: if a polynomial has real coefficients and has a complex root \\(z\\), then its complex conjugate \\(\\overline{z}\\) is also a root; we say that complex roots appear in complex conjugate pairs in real polynomials. 5.3 The argument, polar and exponential form for complex numbers If we think of the complex number \\(z = x + iy\\) as a point \\(P = z\\) in the \\((x,y)\\)-plane, then it is natural to think also of representing \\(P\\) in polar coordinates \\((r,\\theta)\\)  see figure 5.2. Figure 5.2: The complex number \\(z = x + iy\\) in polar coordinates. Here, \\(r = |z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\) is the distance from the origin \\(O\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the positive real axis and the line \\(OP\\). We call \\(\\theta\\) the argument of \\(z\\), denoted \\(\\theta = \\arg(z)\\). We have that \\[ P = (x,y) \\quad \\text{(in Cartesian coordinates)}\\quad \\text{or} \\quad P = (r,\\theta) \\quad \\text{(in Polar coordinates)} \\] with \\[\\begin{array}{rrclcrcl} &amp; r &amp;=&amp; \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} &amp; \\quad\\text{and}\\quad &amp; \\tan(\\theta) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{y}{x},\\\\ \\text{or} \\qquad &amp; x &amp;=&amp; r \\cos(\\theta) &amp; \\quad\\text{and}\\quad &amp; y &amp;=&amp; r \\sin(\\theta). \\end{array}\\] Therefore, we can recover the Cartesian coordinates of \\(P\\) from the polar form \\((r, \\theta)\\) of a complex number \\(z\\) as \\[ z = r \\cos(\\theta) + i (r \\sin(\\theta)) = r (\\cos(\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta)), \\] Theorem 5.2 (Euler's formula) For any real number \\(\\theta\\), \\[ e^{i\\theta}=\\cos (\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta). \\] This can be derived from the power series of \\(e^\\theta, \\sin(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\). Eulers formula allows us to write any complex number \\(z\\) in yet another form, the exponential form of \\(z\\): \\[ z = r (\\cos (\\theta) + i \\sin (\\theta)) = re^{i\\theta}. \\] Note that since \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\) are periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\), there are actually an infinite number of ways of expressing a complex number in polar or exponential form; for any integer value of \\(m\\) \\[re^{i(\\theta+2m\\pi)}=r(\\cos(\\theta+2m\\pi)+i\\sin(\\theta+2m\\pi))=r(\\cos(\\theta)+i\\sin(\\theta))=re^{i\\theta}=w\\] so we can add any multiple of \\(2m\\pi\\) to \\(\\theta\\) and get the same complex number. Graphically, this corresponds to going around a full circle \\(m\\) times in the complex plane and back to the same point. Figure 5.3: A complex number \\(w=re^{i\\theta}\\) plotted in the complex plane. Drag the sliders to vary \\(\\theta\\) and \\(r\\). [Open graph in browser.] The usual rules of exponents hold for complex exponentials, now using the rules of complex arithmetic. The exponential form is particularly nice when taking the product of two complex numbers. For \\(z = re^{i\\theta}\\) and \\(w = se^{i\\phi}\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} u &amp;= (re^{i\\theta}) \\times (se^{i\\phi})\\\\ &amp;= rs e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} \\\\ &amp;= R e^{i\\alpha}, \\end{align*}\\] where \\(R = rs\\) is the distance of \\(u\\) from the origin and \\(\\alpha = \\theta + \\phi\\) is the argument of \\(u\\). Caution: For \\(z = x + iy\\) (with \\(x \\neq 0\\)), if \\(\\theta = \\arg(z)\\) then we always have \\(\\tan (\\theta) = y/x\\). However, this does not mean that \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(y/x)\\). The \\(\\tan^{-1}\\) (or \\(\\arctan\\)) function can only give values in the first and fourth quadrants (between \\(-\\pi/2\\) and \\(\\pi/2\\)), but the argument of a complex number could be in any of the four quadrants (between \\(-\\pi\\) and \\(\\pi\\)). Therefore, to find the argument of a complex number always draw a diagram. (A quick sketch is all that is needed.) 5.4 Roots of complex numbers We know that square roots of positive real numbers have two solutions, for example \\(\\sqrt{4}=\\pm 2\\). This agrees with Theorem (thm:FTA) as we could formulate this as a solution to the equation \\[x^2=4\\] which is the quadratic \\[x^2-4=0\\] and so must have two roots. More generally, the \\(n^\\text{th}\\) root of any number \\(w\\) can be formulated as the solutions to the polynomial equation \\[z^n-w=0.\\] Theorem (thm:FTA) implies that there are \\(n\\) solutions, allowing for these to be complex numbers. Furthermore, it turns out that these roots will be distinct (no repeated roots). The easiest way to find these roots is using the exponential form. We can write \\(w\\) as \\[w=re^{i\\theta}\\] then the first \\(n^\\text{th}\\) root is \\[w^{\\frac{1}{n}}=(re^{i\\theta})^\\frac{1}{n}=r^\\frac{1}{n}e^{i\\frac{\\theta}{n}}\\] but where are the remaining \\(n-1\\) roots? Well, since we can also write \\(w=re^{i(\\theta+2m\\pi)}\\), so \\[w^{\\frac{1}{n}}=r^{\\frac{1}{n}}e^{i(\\frac{\\theta}{n}+\\frac{2m}{n}\\pi)}\\] and we have a distinct solution for all values of \\(m=0,\\dotsc,n-1\\). Once we reach \\(m=n\\) we have gone full circle and are back to the original solution. To double check these are solutions, we can take them to the power \\(n\\) \\[\\begin{align*} (r^{\\frac{1}{n}}e^{i(\\frac{\\theta}{n}+\\frac{2m}{n}\\pi)})^n&amp;=re^{in(\\frac{\\theta}{n}+\\frac{2m}{n}\\pi)}\\\\ &amp;=re^{i(\\frac{n\\theta}{n}+\\frac{2mn}{n}\\pi)}\\\\ &amp;=re^{i(\\theta+2m\\pi)}\\\\ &amp;=re^{i\\theta}\\\\ &amp;=w. \\end{align*}\\] Geometrically, these \\(n\\) solutions are evenly spaced around a circle of radius \\(r^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\) in the complex plane, with an angle of \\(\\frac{2}{n}\\pi\\) between them. Example 5.4 (Complex roots) Find the cube roots of \\(z=2\\) and sketch them in the complex plane. We first write \\(z=2+0i\\) in exponential form \\[z=2e^{i0}\\] then the solutions are \\[\\begin{align*} w_1&amp;=\\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i0}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\\\ w_2&amp;=\\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i(0+\\frac{2\\pi}{3})}=\\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\\\\ w_3&amp;=\\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i(0+\\frac{2(2)\\pi}{3})}=\\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} \\end{align*}\\] Figure 5.4: The cube roots of \\(2\\) in the complex plane. Note they are evenly spaced around a circle of radius \\(\\sqrt[3]{2}\\). 5.5 \\(e^{i\\theta}\\) and trigonometric identities There are many double angle, and similar, formulas relating the various trig. functions. Remembering them can be quite a struggle. In fact we can recover them easily using complex numbers in polar form: \\[ e^{i \\theta} = \\cos (\\theta) + i \\sin (\\theta). \\] So for arbitrary \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\) \\[ e^{i \\theta} e^{i \\phi} = \\begin{cases} (\\cos (\\theta) + i \\sin (\\theta)) \\times (\\cos (\\phi) + i \\sin (\\phi)) &amp; \\text{or} \\\\ e^{i (\\theta + \\phi)} = \\cos (\\theta + \\phi) + i \\sin (\\theta + \\phi). \\end{cases} \\] It follows that \\[\\begin{align*} (\\cos (\\theta) + i \\sin (\\theta)) \\times (\\cos (\\phi) + i \\sin (\\phi)) &amp;= \\cos (\\theta) \\cos (\\phi) - \\sin (\\theta) \\sin (\\phi) + i (\\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\phi) + \\sin (\\theta) \\cos (\\phi))\\\\ &amp;= \\cos (\\theta + \\phi) + i \\sin (\\theta + \\phi) \\end{align*}\\] and equating real and imaginary parts on the left and right hand sides gives: \\[ \\cos (\\theta) \\cos (\\phi) - \\sin (\\theta) \\sin (\\phi) = \\cos (\\theta + \\phi) \\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\phi) + \\sin (\\theta) \\cos (\\phi) = \\sin (\\theta + \\phi) \\] Engineers often use the notation \\(j\\) instead of \\(i\\). "],["vectors.html", "Chapter 6 Vectors 6.1 Vector addition 6.2 Scalar multiplication 6.3 Vectors in Cartesian coordinates 6.4 Vector products", " Chapter 6 Vectors In physics, we distiguish between scalar quantities and vector quantities: Scalars are defined by a single numeric value. Examples include distance, speed, time, temperature, pressure, mass and energy. Vectors have associated both a numeric value and a direction. Examples include displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, and momentum. We depict vectors by arrows whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the quantity in question and whose direction is that of the action of the quantity. In symbols, we will use bold typeface to indicate a vector, such as \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), and we will denote a vector from point \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) by \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\). See figure 6.1.

The swallows groundspeed can be found by adding the velocity vectors: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{v} &amp;= 40 \\text{ km/h North}\\\\ \\mathbf{w} &amp;= 20 \\text{ km/h West}\\\\ \\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}&amp;=20\\sqrt{5} \\text{ km/h North by North West}. \\end{align*}\\] Alternatively, we can use the parallelogram rule (which amounts to the same thing): we draw a parallelogram with two of the non-parallel sides given by the vectors and take the diagonal as the resultant vector, as in figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Parallelogram for addition of two vectors \\(\\textbf{v}\\) and \\(\\textbf{w}\\). 6.2 Scalar multiplication If we multiply a vector by a positive scalar, we change only the magnitude of the vector and keep its direction. For example, if the swallow in example 6.1 starts flying twice as fast, we have the velocity vector \\[2\\mathbf{v} = 80 \\text{ km/h North}.\\] If we multiply by a negative value, the vector now points in the opposite direction: \\[-2\\mathbf{v} = 80 \\text{ km/h South}.\\] Figure 6.4: Scalar multiplication of a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Finally, if we multiply by \\(0\\), we get the zero-vector \\(\\mathbf{0}\\), which has magnitude \\(0\\) and no direction: \\[0\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\]. 6.3 Vectors in Cartesian coordinates We mostly deal with vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system. We then define vectors of length 1 that point out from the origin along the coordinate axes. In three dimensions we label these as \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis, \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) along the \\(y\\)-axis and \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) along the \\(z\\)-axis. In two dimensions we simply drop the \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) vector. We can then write any vector \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) from the origin \\(O\\) to a point \\(A\\) as some combination of the these vectors. For example, the vector in the plane from the origin to the point \\(A=(2,3)\\) is given by: \\[\\overrightarrow{OA}=2\\mathbf{i} + 3\\mathbf{j}.\\] We can reconcile this with our geometric understanding of addition of two vectors: we place the vector \\(2\\mathbf{i}\\) from the origin to the point \\((2,0)\\) and then place the tail of the vector \\(3\\mathbf{j}\\) at the head of \\(2\\mathbf{i}\\) to get to the point \\((2,3)\\); or, in terms of the parallelogram rule we have a rectangle with sides \\(2\\mathbf{i}\\) and \\(3\\mathbf{j}\\). See figure 6.5. Figure 6.5: The vector \\(2\\mathbf{i}+3\\mathbf{j}\\). Yet another way to write this vector is as a column vector \\[\\overrightarrow{OA}= \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Such a representation is called a coordinate vector. More generally, the vector \\[\\mathbf{v}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}\\] can be written as the column \\[\\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Now addition and scalar multiplication can be carried out component-wise as follows. If we have \\[\\mathbf{v}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}\\] and \\[\\mathbf{w}=x&#39;\\mathbf{i}+y&#39;\\mathbf{j}+z&#39;\\mathbf{k}\\] then \\[\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}=(x+x&#39;)\\mathbf{i}+(y+y&#39;)\\mathbf{j}+(z+z&#39;)\\mathbf{k}\\] and with \\(a\\) a scalar, \\[a\\mathbf{v}=ax\\mathbf{i}+ay\\mathbf{j}+az\\mathbf{k}.\\] Or, as column vectors with \\[ \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad \\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} x&#39;\\\\ y&#39;\\\\ z&#39; \\end{pmatrix} \\] we have \\[\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}= \\begin{pmatrix} x+x&#39;\\\\ y+y&#39;\\\\ z+z&#39; \\end{pmatrix}. \\] and \\[ a\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax\\\\ ay\\\\ az \\end{pmatrix}. \\] If points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have coordinates \\((a_1,a_2,a_3)\\) and \\((b_1,b_2,b_3)\\), respectively, then the vector from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is \\[\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 - a_1 \\\\ b_2 - a_2\\\\ b_3 - a_3\\end{pmatrix}. \\] In 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, the length of the vector \\[\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\ y\\\\ z\\end{pmatrix}\\] is written as \\(|\\mathbf{v}|\\) and defined as \\[|\\mathbf{v}| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\\]. This is essentially a three-dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem. A vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is said to be a unit vector if it has unit length. That is, if \\(|\\mathbf{u}| = 1\\). For any non-zero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), the vector \\[ \\mathbf{u}=\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{v}|} \\mathbf{v} \\] is a unit vector in the same direction as \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Example 6.2 Let \\[\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\ -3\\\\ 6\\end{pmatrix}\\] Then the length of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is \\(|\\mathbf{v}| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2} = 7\\). So the unit vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) parallel to \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is \\[ \\mathbf{u}=\\frac{1}{7}\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\ -3\\\\ 6\\end{pmatrix}. \\] 6.4 Vector products We have seen how to add vectors and how to multiply vectors with a scalar. In the following, we see how to multiply two vectors with each other. 6.4.1 Dot product The dot product (also called the scalar product or inner product) of two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), denoted \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}\\), is defined to be the quantity \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = |\\mathbf{u}||\\mathbf{v}|\\cos(\\theta) \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Note that the symmetry of the \\(\\cos\\) function means it does not matter which direction we measure the angle, i.e. clockwise or anticlockwise. Figure 6.6: The projection of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). An immediate application of the scalar product is the projection of one vector onto another. Consider Figure 6.6, which shows the projection of the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). We drop a line from the tip of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) running at right angles to the direction of the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). This is akin to thinking of the shadow that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) would cast on the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) if the Sun is shining at right angles to \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). The length of the shadow is the projection of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), or \\[|\\mathbf{v}|\\cos(\\theta).\\] We have: \\[\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} &amp;= |\\mathbf{u}| \\times \\text{projection of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto $\\mathbf{u}$}\\] Since there was nothing special about choosing the projection onto \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)  we could have chosen the projection onto \\(\\mathbf{u}\\)  it is also true that: \\[\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}= |\\mathbf{v}| \\times \\text{projection of $\\mathbf{u}$ onto $\\mathbf{v}$}.\\] Example 6.3 (Work) An application of the dot product in physics is to the concept of work. We want to consider how much work is required to push a block over a certain distance \\(x\\). By calculation or measurement, we can determine the force \\(F\\) required to push the block. Then, by definition, the work done by the force is \\[W = Fx.\\] This is sufficient if the force acts in the same direction as the motion of the block. If, however, this is not the case (maybe the block is constrained to move on a rail), then it is the component of the force in the direction of motion that is important. Suppose \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is the force vector and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is the displacement vector of the block. Let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle between the two vectors. Then the component of \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) in the \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) direction is precisely the projection of \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (as described in Figure 6.6). This is equal to \\[ |\\mathbf{F}|\\cos(\\theta). \\] So the total work done will be the product of this quantity with the magnitude of the displacement vector, that is \\[\\begin{align*} W &amp;= |\\mathbf{F}|\\cos(\\theta) \\times |\\mathbf{x}| \\\\ &amp;= |\\mathbf{F}||\\mathbf{x}|\\cos(\\theta) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}, \\end{align*}\\] i.e. the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Note that if the dot product is \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=0\\) then either \\(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2})=0\\) so that the two vectors are perpendicular, or one or both of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are the zero vector \\(\\mathbf{0}\\). When the dot product is zero, we say that the two vectors are orthogonal. Some other properties of the dot product that follow from the definition are: \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}\\); \\((a\\mathbf{u}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (a\\mathbf{v})= a(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})\\); \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\); \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u} = |\\mathbf{u}|^2\\). Theorem 6.1 (Calculating the dot product) In Cartesian coordinates, the dot product of two vectors \\[\\mathbf{u} = x\\mathbf{i} + y\\mathbf{j} + z\\mathbf{k} \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad \\mathbf{v} = a\\mathbf{i} + b\\mathbf{j} + c\\mathbf{k}\\] can be calulated as \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = (x\\mathbf{i} + y\\mathbf{j} + z\\mathbf{k})\\cdot(a\\mathbf{i} + b\\mathbf{j} + c\\mathbf{k}) = xa + yb + zc. \\end{equation*}\\] To see this, consider the full product: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} &amp;= xa \\mathbf{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{i} + xb \\mathbf{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{j} + xc \\mathbf{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{k} \\\\ &amp;\\phantom{={}} + ya \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{i} + yb \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{j} + yc \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{k} \\\\ &amp;\\phantom{={}} + za \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{i} + zb \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{j} + zc \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{k} \\\\ &amp;= xa + yb + zc, \\end{align*}\\] then noting that the unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{i}\\), \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) have unit length and are perpendicular to one another, we first have by the property \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=|\\mathbf{u}|^2\\) that \\[ \\mathbf{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{i} = \\mathbf{j}\\cdot\\mathbf{j} =\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{k}=1, \\] and secondly, by orthogonality each of the following products are zero \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{j}&amp;,\\; \\mathbf{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}\\\\ \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{i}&amp;,\\; \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}\\\\ \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{i}&amp;,\\; \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{j}. \\end{align*}\\] Example 6.4 (Geometry) Consider a triangle in three-dimensional space whose vertices are given by the points \\[ A = (2,4,-1),\\quad B = (0,3,1), \\quad C = (-3,1,5). \\] We compute the side lengths and angles for the triangle \\(ABC\\) above. First note that \\[ \\overrightarrow{AB} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ 3\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\ 4\\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2\\\\ -1\\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix} \\] and similarly \\[ \\overrightarrow{BC} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3\\\\ -2\\\\ 4\\end{pmatrix} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\overrightarrow{CA} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5\\\\ 3\\\\ -6\\end{pmatrix}. \\] From this, we can immediately calculate the length of the sides, namely \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp;= |\\overrightarrow{AB}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2} = 3, \\\\ BC &amp;= |\\overrightarrow{BC}| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-2)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{29}, \\\\ CA &amp;= |\\overrightarrow{CA}| = \\sqrt{5^2 + 3^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{70}. \\end{align*}\\] The angles can then be computed using the dot product. For instance, the angle \\(\\theta_A\\) at the vertex \\(A\\) can be computed via \\[ \\cos(\\theta_A) = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{AB}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{AC}}{AB\\times AC} = -\\frac{\\overrightarrow{AB}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{CA}}{AB\\times CA}, \\] thus \\[ \\cos(\\theta_A) = -\\frac{-2\\times 5 - 1\\times 3 + 2\\times(-6)}{3\\sqrt{70}} = \\frac{25}{3\\sqrt{70}} = \\frac{25\\sqrt{70}}{3\\times 70} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{70}}{42}. \\] Similarly, we calculate \\[ \\cos(\\theta_B) = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{BA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{BC}}{BA\\times BC} = -\\frac{16}{87}\\sqrt{29}. \\] and \\[ \\cos(\\theta_C) = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{CA}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{CB}}{CA\\times CB} = \\frac{9}{406}\\sqrt{29}\\sqrt{70}. \\] 6.4.2 Cross product Let \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) be vectors in a three-dimensional space and let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle between the vectors. Note there are potentially two choices for the angle between two vectors: both \\(\\theta\\) and \\(2\\pi - \\theta\\). Unlike the case of the dot product, we need to be clear about our choice of angle \\(\\theta\\). We choose the angle \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(0 \\le \\theta &lt; \\pi\\). The cross product (or vector product) \\(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v}\\) of two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in three-dimensional space is defined to be the (unique) vector of length \\[ |\\mathbf{u}||\\mathbf{v}|\\sin(\\theta) \\] that is orthogonal to both the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), such that \\(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v}\\) form a right-handed system. The last part of the definition needs some explanation. There are always two possible directions that are perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and to \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), one being the opposite of the other. When we say that a set of three vectors \\(\\{\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}\\}\\) forms a right-handed system, we mean that if take our right hand and point our thumb in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and our index finger in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), then our middle finger points (roughly) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). From Figure 6.7 we see that \\(\\{\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v}\\}\\) form a right-handed system. Figure 6.7: The cross product of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). The cross product has the following properties: \\(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v} = -(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{u})\\); \\(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) if and only if \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are parallel, or \\(\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\); \\(|\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v}| = |\\mathbf{u}||\\mathbf{v}|\\) if and only if \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are orthogonal; \\((a\\mathbf{u})\\times\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}\\times(a\\mathbf{v}) = a(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v})\\); \\(\\mathbf{u}\\times(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{w}\\). It follows that: \\[ \\begin{array}{rclrclrcl} \\mathbf{i}\\times\\mathbf{j} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{k}, \\qquad &amp; \\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{k} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{i}, \\qquad &amp; \\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{i} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{j},\\\\ \\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{i} &amp;=&amp; -\\mathbf{k}, \\qquad &amp; \\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{j} &amp;=&amp; -\\mathbf{i}, \\qquad &amp; \\mathbf{i}\\times\\mathbf{k} &amp;=&amp; -\\mathbf{j},\\\\ \\mathbf{i}\\times\\mathbf{i} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{0}, \\qquad &amp; \\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{j} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{0}, \\qquad &amp; \\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{k} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{0}. \\end{array} \\] Then we can compute the cross product of \\[ \\mathbf{u} = u_1\\mathbf{i} + u_2\\mathbf{j} + u_3\\mathbf{k} \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad \\mathbf{v} = v_1\\mathbf{i} + v_2\\mathbf{j} + v_3\\mathbf{k}, \\] as \\[ \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2)\\mathbf{i} + (u_3v_1 - u_1v_3)\\mathbf{j} + (u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)\\mathbf{k}. \\] An easy way to remember this is to compute the determinant: \\[ \\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} &amp; \\mathbf{j} &amp; \\mathbf{k}\\\\ u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3\\\\ v_1 &amp; v_2 &amp; v_3\\end{vmatrix}. \\] Example 6.5 (Magnetic fields) The vector product occurs in many equations in physics. For instance, consider a charged particle moving through a magnetic field. Let the charge on the particle be \\(q\\) Coulombs, let its velocity vector be \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) metres per second and let the magnetic field be \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) Teslas. Then the force \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) Newtons experienced by the particle is \\[ \\textbf{F} = q\\mathbf{v}\\times\\textbf{B}. \\] This formula expresses mathematically the fact that the force experienced by the particle is perpendicular to its direction of motion and to the magnetic field. Example 6.6 (Triangle area) What is the area of the triangle with vertices \\[ A = (2,4,-1), \\qquad B = (0,3,1), \\qquad C = (-3,1,5)? \\] Note that this is the same triangle that we considered in Example @ref{exm:dottriangle}, where we considered the lengths of the sides and the angles at the vertices. Figure 6.8: Computing the area of a triangle via the vector product. The area of a triangle is half its base times its height. In view of the diagram in Figure 6.8, the base is \\(|\\overrightarrow{AB}|\\) and the height is \\(|\\overrightarrow{AC}| \\sin(\\theta_A)\\), so the area of the triangle is \\[ \\frac{1}{2} |\\overrightarrow{AB}||\\overrightarrow{AC}| \\sin(\\theta_A). \\] This quantity can be computed in terms of the vector product as \\[ \\frac{1}{2} |\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}|. \\] Using the determinant method for computing the vector product, we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} \\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} &amp; \\mathbf{j} &amp; \\mathbf{k}\\\\ -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ -5 &amp; -3 &amp; 6\\end{vmatrix} = (-6 + 6)\\mathbf{i} - (-12 + 10)\\mathbf{j} + (6 - 5)\\mathbf{k} = 2\\mathbf{j} + \\mathbf{k}. \\end{align*}\\] Thus, \\[ |\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5}, \\] and we deduce that the area of the triangle \\(ABC\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\). "],["systems-of-linear-equations.html", "Chapter 7 Systems of Linear Equations 7.1 Lines and planes 7.2 Solving linear systems - Gaussian elimination 7.3 Echelon Form", " Chapter 7 Systems of Linear Equations So-called linear equations arise often in mathematical problems in science and engineering. In this chapter we will see a very useful method for solving simultaneous linear equations, known as Gaussian elimination. Well start by understanding the geometric nature of linear equations. 7.1 Lines and planes A linear equation is one of the form \\[a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\\dotsb+a_nx_n=b\\] where the \\(x_i\\)s are variables, the \\(a_i\\)s are coefficients, \\(b\\) is a constant and \\(n\\) is the number of variables in the equation. For \\(n=2\\), we have an equation of the form \\[a_1x_1+a_2x_2=b\\] which we know to be the equation of a line in the Cartesian plane (see section 3.1, where we used the notation \\(ax+by=c\\)). Suppose we have a pair of such equations. Then we could conveniently write them as \\[\\begin{align*} a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2&amp;=b_1\\\\ a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2&amp;=b_2 \\end{align*}\\] where now the first subscipt \\(i\\) on the \\(a_{ij}\\)s and \\(b_i\\)s denotes the equation it belongs to and the second subscipt \\(j\\) denotes the variable it belongs to. If we need to solve these equations to find the values of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) that satisfy both equations simultaneously, then we call this a system of linear simultaneous equations. Figure 7.1: The two intersecting lines from example (exm:gaus1). Geometrically, a solution to the equations corresponds to those coordinates \\((x_1,x_2)\\) where the lines meet  these are values of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) that satisfy both equations simultaneously  see figure (fig:sim-lines). We therefore have three different scenarios for the solutions of such equations. Most of the time, two lines in the plane will cross at exactly one point, hence we have just one solution (one pair of coordinates \\((x_1,x_2)\\)). It is possible that both lines are parallel to one another, with different axis intercepts. In this case, the lines never meet  there are no solutions. Finally, it is possible that the two equations actually describe the same line. In this case, any pair of coordinates \\((x_1,x_2)\\) that lies on the (common) line is a solution  there are infinitely many solutions. This idea extends to having more equations. For example, if we have a system of three equations in two variables: \\[\\begin{align*} a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2&amp;=b_1\\\\ a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2&amp;=b_2\\\\ a_{31}x_1+a_{32}x_2&amp;=b_3 \\end{align*}\\] Then it is possible that: All three lines will cross at exactly one point, hence we have just one solution. The three lines dont cross at a common point  there are no solutions. This is the most probable scenario in this set-up: whilst any two of the lines might cross at a point, we need all three to cross at the same point in order for there to be a solution to the simultaneous equations. Finally, it is possible that the three equations actually describe the same line and again there are infinitely many solutions. When there are more equations than variables, the system is sometimes called overdetermined, since then we usually have scenario 2 above where trying to satsify the contraints impossed by the three equations is not possible. On the other hand, a system with less equations is sometimes called underdetermined, since in these cases we usually have an infinite number of solutions. For example, if we had a system with just one equation in two variables \\[\\begin{align*} a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2&amp;=b_1\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] then all points \\((x_1,x_2)\\) lying on this line are solutions. We can extend these ideas to higher dimensional systems, i.e. a higher number of variables. For example, if we have three equations in three variables \\[\\begin{align*} a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3&amp;=b_1\\\\ a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3&amp;=b_2\\\\ a_{31}x_1+a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3&amp;=b_3 \\end{align*}\\] then each equation describes a plane in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. Now we have: A unique solution \\((x_1,x_2,x_3)\\) if all three planes cross at a single point  the most likely scenario. No solutions if none of the planes cross at a common point  think about all the ways this could happen, there are more ways than in two dimensions! Infinetely many solutions if all three planes intersect along a line or all are the same plane  again, think about the ways this could happen! You should also think about the meaning of overdetermined and underdetermined systems in 3-dimensions and how they look geometrically. We can of course extend these ideas to as many variables and equations as we wish: a linear equation in \\(n\\) variables represents a hyperplane in \\(n\\)-dimensional space, which is a subspace with dimension \\(n-1\\), but is impossible for us to directly visualise things in dimensions greater than 3! 7.2 Solving linear systems - Gaussian elimination There are a number of different approaches to solving linear equations. They all ultimately amount to the same thing, but some methods are more straighforward or computationally efficient depending on the situation. In example 2.4 we use rearrangement and substitution to solve \\[\\begin{align*} 3x_1+2x_2&amp;=5\\\\ x_1-4x_2&amp;=1. \\end{align*}\\] Now we will instead add and subtract multiples of each equation to reduce them to the solution. Example 7.1 Solve \\[\\begin{align*} 3x_1+2x_2&amp;=5\\\\ x_1-4x_2&amp;=1. \\end{align*}\\] First, lets swap the order of the equations so that the coefficient of \\(x_1\\) in the first equation is \\(1\\) \\[\\begin{align*} x_1-4x_2&amp;=1\\\\ 3x_1+2x_2&amp;=5. \\end{align*}\\] Next, we subtract 3 times the first equation from the second to eliminate \\(x_1\\) from the second equation. The second equation becomes \\[\\begin{align*} 3x_1+2x_2-3(x_1-4x_2)&amp;=5-3\\times 1\\\\ 14x_2&amp;=2 \\end{align*}\\] so we have the equivalent system \\[\\begin{align*} x_1-4x_2&amp;=1\\\\ 14x_2&amp;=2. \\end{align*}\\] Now divide the second equation by 14 \\[\\begin{align*} x_1-4x_2&amp;=1\\\\ x_2&amp;=\\frac{1}{7}. \\end{align*}\\] Add 4 times the second equation to the first to eliminate \\(x_2\\) from the first equation \\[\\begin{align*} x_1-4x_2+4x_2&amp;=1+\\frac{4}{7}\\\\ x_2&amp;=\\frac{1}{7}. \\end{align*}\\] and hence we have the solution \\[\\begin{align*} x_1&amp;=\\frac{11}{7}\\\\ x_2&amp;=\\frac{1}{7}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that in the above example, it is the coefficients \\(a_{ij}\\) and \\(b_i\\) that we are manipulating  the \\(x_j\\)s just came along for the ride. So, lets simplify things by just writing down the coefficients in the system of equations in a table as follows: \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{rr|r} 3&amp;2\\\\ 1&amp;-4 \\end{array} \\right). \\] This is called the matrix of coefficients. We also need to keep track of the right-hand side of the equation, so we add this as another column separated by a vertical line: \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{rr|r} 3&amp;2&amp;5\\\\ 1&amp;-4&amp;1 \\end{array} \\right). \\] We call this the augmented matrix. Now in solving the system of equations, we simply add/subtract multiples of rows of this augmented matrix. Labelling each row as \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) we perform the following operations: swap rows 1 and 2: \\(R_1\\leftrightarrow R_2\\) \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{rr|r} 1&amp;-4&amp;1\\\\ 3&amp;2&amp;5 \\end{array} \\right). \\] subtract 3 times row 1 from row 2: \\(R_2 \\to R_2-3R_1\\) \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{rr|r} 1&amp;-4&amp;1\\\\ 0&amp;14&amp;2 \\end{array} \\right). \\] divide row 2 by 14: \\(R_2\\to \\frac{1}{14}R_2\\) \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{rr|r} 1&amp;-4&amp;1\\\\ 0&amp;1&amp;\\frac{1}{7} \\end{array} \\right). \\] add 4 times the second row to the first: \\(R_1 \\to R_1+4 R_2\\) \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{rr|r} 1&amp;0&amp;\\frac{11}{7}\\\\ 0&amp;1&amp;\\frac{1}{7} \\end{array} \\right) \\] This represents \\[\\begin{align*} 1\\times x_1 + 0 \\times x_2 &amp;=x_1= \\frac{11}{7}\\\\ 0\\times x_1 + 1 \\times x_2 &amp;=x_2= \\frac{1}{7}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] that is, we can just read off the solutions in the right-most column. This method is known as Gaussian9 elimination and provides a systematic way to solve simultaneous linear equations. Note that each step in the above process is reversible. For instance, the operation \\[R_1 \\to R_1 + 4R_2\\] can be reversed by performing \\[R_1 \\to R_1 - 4R_2.\\] This means that the final set of equations produced by Gaussian elimination is equivalent to the original set of equations and therefore has the same set of solutions. No matter the number of variables or equations, the aim is to reduce the coefficient matrix to a diagonal of \\(1\\)s (or as close as possible, well clarify this shortly) and \\(0\\)s everywhere else, like so \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{rrrr|r} 1&amp;0&amp;\\dotsb&amp;0&amp;\\omega_1\\\\ 0&amp;1&amp;\\dotsb&amp;0&amp;\\omega_2\\\\ \\vdots&amp;&amp;\\ddots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\vdots\\\\ 0&amp;0&amp;\\dotsb&amp;1&amp;\\omega_n \\end{array} \\right), \\] then read off the solutions as \\(x_1=\\omega_1, x_2=\\omega_2,\\dotsc, x_n=\\omega_n\\) from the right hand column. The following elementary row operations (EROs) comprise all operations required for Gaussian elimination: \\(R_i \\to R_i + \\alpha R_k\\), where \\(k \\neq i\\) and \\(\\alpha \\neq 0\\) is some scalar; \\(R_i \\to \\alpha R_i\\), where \\(\\alpha \\neq 0\\) is some scalar; \\(R_i \\leftrightarrow R_k\\), where \\(k\\neq i\\), denotes the swapping of the \\(i\\)-th and \\(k\\)-th rows. We now present a sketch of the full Gaussian elimination procedure using these EROs. First, note that we call the first non-zero entry (reading from left to right) in any row of a matrix the leading entry. A leading entry will always be used as a pivot, where a pivot is an element used to zero-out the other entries in the same column as the pivot. select the leading entry in the top row as a pivot; perform EROs to eliminate the entries below the pivot; move down to the next row and continue the process; having reached the bottom row, work back up again, that is: select the bottom right entry in the matrix of coefficients as the pivot; perform EROs to eliminate the entries above the pivot; move to the row above and continue the process; having reached the top row, stop and read off the solutions. Lets have a look at another example applying these steps, this time in 3-dimensions. Example 7.2 Solve the system of equations \\[\\begin{align*} x+y+z&amp;=3,\\\\ 2x+3y+z&amp;=10, \\\\ 3x-y+2z&amp;=-2. \\end{align*}\\] We start by writing down the augmented matrix: \\[ \\left(\\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 10 \\\\ 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right). \\] We select the top-left hand entry of the augmented matrix as a pivot. We eliminate the entries in the same column that lie below the pivot, that is \\[\\require{enclose} \\begin{array}{l} \\phantom{\\enclose{circle}{1}}\\quad \\\\ R_2 \\to R_2 - 2R_1\\colon \\quad\\\\ R_3 \\to R_3 - 3R_1\\colon \\quad \\end{array} \\left(\\begin{array}{crr|r} \\enclose{circle}{1} &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; -4 &amp; -1 &amp; -11 \\end{array}\\right). \\] Then we select the first non-zero entry in the second row as our pivot and eliminate the entry below it, to obtain \\[ \\begin{array}{l} \\quad \\\\ \\phantom{\\enclose{circle}{1}} \\quad\\\\ R_3 \\to R_3 + 4R_2\\colon \\quad \\end{array} \\left(\\begin{array}{rcr|r} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\enclose{circle}{1} &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -5 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right). \\] Next perform \\[ \\begin{array}{l} \\quad \\\\ \\quad\\\\ R_3 \\to -\\frac{1}{5}R_3\\colon \\quad \\end{array} \\left( \\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3, \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1&amp; 4, \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1&amp; -1. \\end{array}\\right). \\] We continue, similarly to the steps above, by eliminating the entries above the pivot in the bottom row. \\[ \\begin{array}{l} R_1 \\to R_1 - R_3\\colon \\quad \\\\ R_2 \\to R_2 + R_3\\colon \\quad \\\\ \\phantom{\\enclose{circle}{1}}\\quad \\end{array} \\left(\\begin{array}{rrc|r} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\enclose{circle}{1} &amp;-1 \\end{array}\\right). \\] Finally, we eliminate the second column using the \\(1\\) in the second row as a pivot, that is \\[ \\begin{array}{l} R_1 \\to R_1 - R_2\\colon \\quad \\\\ \\phantom{\\enclose{circle}{1}}\\quad \\\\ \\quad \\end{array} \\left(\\begin{array}{rcr|r} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\enclose{circle}{1} &amp; 0 &amp; 3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right). \\] We read off the solution \\((x,y,z) = (1,3,-1)\\). 7.3 Echelon Form Recall that in general there may be one, none or infinitely many solutions to a system of linear equations. We now see what happens in Guassian elimination in these scenarios. When following the proceedure of Gaussian elimination we reduce the coefficient matrix to make the leading entry in each row equal to 1 and then clear all the values (make them zero) above and below this entry. This results in a coefficient matrix in what is known as reduced echelon form. This allows us to easily read off the solutions. Here is a formal definition of the reduced echelon form. Definition 7.1 (Reduced Echelon Form) A matrix is said to be in reduced echelon form (REF) if 1. all the rows consisting entirely of zeros lie below all non-zero rows (note, there need not be any zero or non-zero rows); 1. each leading entry in a row lies at least one place to the right of all leading entries in any previous rows; 1. every leading entry is \\(1\\); 1. each leading entry is the only non-zero entry in its column. The following are some examples of possible reduced echelon forms for \\(3\\times 3\\) coefficient matrices. \\[ \\left(\\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\omega_3 \\end{array}\\right),\\qquad \\left(\\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; \\omega_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_3 \\end{array}\\right),\\qquad \\left(\\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\omega_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_3 \\end{array}\\right). \\] The previous examples were all square coefficient matrices (the same number of equations as variables). It is also possible that we have rectangular coefficient matrices. Here are some possible echelon forms. \\[ \\left(\\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\omega_3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_4 \\end{array}\\right),\\qquad \\left(\\begin{array}{rrrr|r} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -4&amp;\\omega_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\omega_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_3 \\end{array}\\right),\\qquad \\left(\\begin{array}{rrrr|r} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\omega_3 \\end{array}\\right). \\] Note that the reduced echelon form resuts in a staircase of \\(1\\)s appearing either on or above the diagonal, with all entries below the staircase being zero. We can only take one step down any column, but might take multiple steps right along a row. So far, we have only seen examples like the first matrix above, where we have a diagonal of \\(1\\)s. Since in this case we simply read off the solutions, it is easy to see that such forms result in a unique solution. We now give some examples and interpretations for other echelon forms. In the following \\(\\alpha_i\\) and \\(\\omega_i\\) can be any value. Example 7.3 (Zero coefficient row) \\[ \\left(\\begin{array}{rcr|r} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\alpha &amp; \\omega_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\omega_3 \\end{array}\\right),\\qquad \\] If \\(\\omega_3=0\\) the equations read \\[\\begin{align*} x_1+\\alpha x_3&amp;=\\omega_1\\\\ x_2&amp;=\\omega_2\\\\ 0&amp;=0 \\end{align*}\\] In effect, we only have two equations. There is no constraint on \\(x_3\\) and we call this a free variable. We can parameterise the solution by setting \\(x_3=\\beta\\) where \\(\\beta\\) can take any values  there are infinitely many solutions. So the solution is all points \\[(\\omega_1-\\alpha\\beta,\\omega_2,\\beta).\\] Geometrically, this is a line in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates which is drawn by varying \\(\\beta\\). On the other hand, if \\(\\omega_3\\neq 0\\), then in the bottom row we have the equation \\[0=\\omega_3\\] which is not possible. In this case, there are no solutions to the system of equations. We sometimes say that the set of equations is inconsistent. Example 7.4 (A rectangular reduced echelon form) \\[ \\left(\\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\alpha_2 &amp; \\omega_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\alpha_3 &amp; 0 &amp; \\alpha_4 &amp; \\omega_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\alpha_5 &amp; \\omega_3 \\end{array}\\right). \\] In this case, we have the solutions \\[\\begin{align*} x_1 &amp; = \\omega_1 - \\alpha_1x_3 - \\alpha_2x_5\\\\ x_2 &amp; = \\omega_2 - \\alpha_3x_3 -\\alpha_4 x_5\\\\ x_4 &amp; = \\omega_3 - \\alpha_5x_5 \\end{align*}\\] where \\(x_3\\) and \\(x_5\\) are free variables, and hence we can set them as parameterise \\(x_3=\\beta\\), \\(x_4=\\gamma\\). More generally, any column that does not have a leading entry will correspond to a free variable. Since we have 2 parameters, this describes a plane in 5-dimensional space. The solution is all points \\[(\\omega_1 - \\alpha_1\\beta - \\alpha_2\\gamma, \\omega_2 - \\alpha_3\\beta -\\alpha_4\\gamma, \\beta, \\omega_3 - \\alpha_5\\gamma, \\gamma).\\] The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (17771855) born in Braunschweig in the Holy Roman Empire, in what is now Germany. Gauss worked at the University of Gottingen. "],["matrices.html", "Chapter 8 Matrices 8.1 Solving linear systems revisited 8.2 Determinants", " Chapter 8 Matrices A matrix \\(A\\) is a two-dimensional array of numbers. We say that \\(A\\) is an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix if it has \\(m\\) rows and \\(n\\) columns, for some natural numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). We use the notation \\[ A = (a_{ij})_{m \\times n}, \\qquad \\text{or more simply} \\qquad A = (a_{ij}), \\] to indicate that the entry in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\) of \\(A\\) is \\(a_{ij}\\). We refer to \\(a_{ij}\\) as the \\(i\\)\\(j\\) entry of the matrix \\(A\\). 8.1 Solving linear systems revisited In the previous chapter, given a set of \\(m\\) linear equations with \\(n\\) variables \\[\\begin{align*} a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{1n}x_n&amp;=b_1\\\\ a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{2n}x_n&amp;=b_2\\\\ \\vdots\\qquad&amp;=\\,\\vdots\\\\ a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{mn}x_n&amp;=b_m \\end{align*}\\] we introduced the coefficient matrix \\[ A= \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}&amp;a_{12}&amp;\\dotsb&amp;a_{1n}\\\\ a_{21}&amp;a_{22}&amp;\\dotsb&amp;a_{2n}\\\\ \\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\dotsb&amp;\\vdots\\\\ a_{m1}&amp;a_{n2}&amp;\\dotsb&amp;a_{mn} \\end{pmatrix}. \\] We will now write the variables and r.h.s. as vectors of length \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) respectively \\[ \\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_m \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Next, we define the operation of multiplying a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) of length \\(n\\) by an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\). The result is a vector of length \\(m\\) whose first entry is the sum of the element-wise products of the first row of \\(A\\) with the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), the second entry is the sum of the element-wise products of the second row of \\(A\\) with the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and so on: \\[ A\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}&amp;a_{12}&amp;\\dotsb&amp;a_{1n}\\\\ a_{21}&amp;a_{22}&amp;\\dotsb&amp;a_{2n}\\\\ \\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\dotsb&amp;\\vdots\\\\ a_{n1}&amp;a_{n2}&amp;\\dotsb&amp;a_{nn} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{1n}x_n\\\\ a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{2n}x_n\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{mn}x_n \\end{pmatrix} \\] Hence we can express the system of equations more compactly as \\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\] where each row of the expanded equation corresponds to one of the linear equations. In the previous chapter we saw that solving such a system corresponds to finding the intersection points of the hyperplanes defined by these rows. We will call this the row picture of linear equations. However, there is another way to interpret \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) in terms of column vectors. We must first introduce some new definitions. Definition 8.1 (Linear combinations) Consider a list of vectors \\[\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2,\\dotsc,\\mathbf{v}_n.\\] A linear combination of a list of vectors is a sum of the form \\[ \\alpha_1\\mathbf{v}_1+\\alpha_2\\mathbf{v}_2 + \\dotsb + \\alpha_n\\mathbf{v}_n \\] for some scalar coefficients \\(\\alpha_i\\). A list of vectors is called linearly independent if we cannot write one of the vectors as a linear combination of the others, such as \\[ \\mathbf{v}_i=\\alpha_1\\mathbf{v}_1+\\alpha_2\\mathbf{v}_2+\\dotsb+\\alpha_{i-1}\\mathbf{v}_{i-1}+\\alpha_{i+1}\\mathbf{v}_{i+1}+\\dotsb+\\alpha_n\\mathbf{v}_n \\] (none of the vectors depends on the others). The span of a list of vectors is all of the possible linear combinations. If we can reach any vector in the space by taking some linear combination then we say the vectors span the space. An intuitive way to think about linearly independent vectors is that they all point in independent directions. An intuitive way to think about the span is as all the points we can reach in the space by only walking in the directions of the list of vectors. Figure 8.1 demonstrates the concepts of linear combinations and span in 2-dimensions. Figure 8.1: Any vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) in the plane can be written as a linear combination of the vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_2\\), that is \\(\\mathbf{u}=\\alpha_1\\mathbf{v}_1+\\alpha_2\\mathbf{v}_2\\). Drag the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) to any point in the plane to see this decomposition. This means that \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_2\\) span the entire plane. You can also drag the vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_2\\) and so long as these point in independent directions they still span the plane; if they lie along the same direction, then they only span a line.[Open plot in browser.] If we consider each column of the matrix \\(A\\) as a vector \\(\\mathbf{a}_i\\) of length \\(m\\), then the multiplication \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) can also be written as \\[\\begin{align*} A\\mathbf{x}&amp;=x_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + x_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + \\dotsb + x_n\\mathbf{a}_n\\\\ &amp;=x_1 \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} \\\\ a_{21} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} \\end{pmatrix} + x_2 \\begin{pmatrix} a_{12} \\\\ a_{22} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{m2} \\end{pmatrix} + \\dotsb + x_n \\begin{pmatrix} a_{1n} \\\\ a_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{mn} \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &amp;= \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{1n}x_n\\\\ a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{2n}x_n\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+\\dotsb+a_{mn}x_n \\end{pmatrix}. \\end{align*}\\] That is, \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) is the linear combination of the columns \\(\\mathbf{a}_i\\) with coefficients \\(x_i\\). We will call this the column picture of matrix equations. As we shall come to see, this different point of view is very powerful in understanding the nature of linear equations. Finding a solution to \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) can now be interpreted as answering the question: can we find a linear combination of the column vectors of \\(A\\) that sum to give the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\)? Or in other words: is the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the span of the columns of \\(A\\)? The question of unique solutions or infinitely many solutions becomes: is there one way or infinitely many ways to take a linear combination of the columns of \\(A\\) to reach the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\)? Or in other words: are the columns of \\(A\\) linearly independent? These questions can once again be answered from inspecting the REF of the augmented matrix. In the statements below we shall refer to the coefficient matrix part of the REF as the l.h.s. and the final augmented column as the r.h.s. If there is a row of zeros in the l.h.s. but a non-zero value in the corresponding row of the r.h.s., then there are no solutions (\\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is not in the span of the columns of \\(A\\)). If all zero rows in the l.h.s. have a zero in the corresponding row of the r.h.s, together with every column in the l.h.s. containing a leading entry, then there is a unique solution (\\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in the span of the columns of \\(A\\) together with the columns being linearly independent). If all zero rows in the l.h.s. have a zero in the corresponding row of the r.h.s, but not every column in the l.h.s. contains a leading entry, then there are infinitely many solutions (\\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in the span of the columns of \\(A\\) but the columns are linearly dependent). A list of vectors that both span the space and are linearly independent are called a basis. A basis can be used as a coordinate system. We generally use the standard basis consisting of the unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{i}, \\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}\\). The coordinates of a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in this basis are the values \\(\\alpha_i\\) in the linear combination \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\alpha_1\\mathbf{i} + \\alpha_2\\mathbf{j} + \\alpha_3\\mathbf{k}\\). If we had a different basis \\(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{r}\\) then we could also express \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) as \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\beta_1\\mathbf{p}+\\beta_2\\mathbf{q}+\\beta_3\\mathbf{r}\\) and specify points using \\(\\beta_1,\\beta_2\\) and \\(\\beta_3\\) as coordinates. 8.2 Determinants When we have a square coefficient matrix \\(A\\), we can find out if there exists a unique solution to \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) for any possible vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) by computing a scalar quantity associated to \\(A\\) known as the determinant. For a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\[ A = \\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b\\\\ c &amp; d\\end{pmatrix} \\] we define the determinant of \\(A\\), written as \\(\\det(A)\\) or \\(|A|\\), as \\[ \\det(A) = \\begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b\\\\ c &amp; d\\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc. \\] Example 8.1 (2x2 determinants) For instance, we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{vmatrix} 1 &amp; 5\\\\ 6 &amp; 2\\end{vmatrix} &amp;= 1\\times 2 - 5\\times 6 = -28,\\\\ \\begin{vmatrix} 2 &amp; -5\\\\ 7 &amp; 3\\end{vmatrix} &amp;= 2\\times 3 - (-5\\times 7) = 41,\\\\ \\begin{vmatrix} a &amp; \\frac{b}{2}\\\\ \\frac{b}{2} &amp; c\\end{vmatrix} &amp; = ac - \\frac{b^2}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}(b^2 - 4ac). \\end{align*}\\] Higher-order determinants are defined recursively in terms of lower-order determinants. For instance, for a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix, we define \\[ \\begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c\\\\ d &amp; e &amp; f\\\\ g &amp; h &amp; i\\end{vmatrix} = a\\begin{vmatrix} e &amp; f\\\\ h &amp; i\\end{vmatrix} - b\\begin{vmatrix} d &amp; f\\\\ g &amp; i\\end{vmatrix} + c\\begin{vmatrix} d &amp; e\\\\ g &amp; h\\end{vmatrix}. \\] Note that the expression above contains three terms, each of which is the product of two factors: an entry of the matrix multiplied by a \\(2\\times 2\\) determinant. Each \\(2\\times 2\\) determinant is formed by crossing out the row and column containing the other factor. Also note the \\(-\\) sign in the second term. Example 8.2 (A 3x3 determinant) Compute the determinant of the matrix \\(A = \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\det(A) = \\begin{vmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9\\end{vmatrix} &amp;= 1\\begin{vmatrix} 5 &amp; 6\\\\ 8 &amp; 9\\end{vmatrix} - 2\\begin{vmatrix} 4 &amp; 6\\\\ 7 &amp; 9\\end{vmatrix} + 3\\begin{vmatrix} 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8\\end{vmatrix} \\\\ &amp;= 1\\left(5\\times 9-6\\times 8\\right) - 2\\left(4\\times 9 - 6\\times 7\\right) + 3(4\\times 8 - 5\\times 7)\\\\ &amp;= -3 - 2(-6)+3(-3)\\\\ &amp;=0 \\end{align*}\\] Theorem 8.1 (Unique solutions) Let \\(A\\) be a square matrix. There is a unique solution to \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) for any vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) if and only if \\(\\det(A)\\neq 0\\). This gives us a useful test if we want to know if there are unique solutions for any vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).

We can calculate torque using the cross product: \\[\\boldsymbol\\tau = \\mathbf{r}\\times \\mathbf{F}\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol\\tau\\) is the torque vector, \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) is the position vector (from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied) and \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is the force vector. Find the torque about the point \\(\\mathbf{i}+2\\mathbf{j}-\\mathbf{k}\\) of a force \\(\\mathbf{F}=3\\mathbf{i}+\\mathbf{k}\\) acting on a particle at position \\(2\\mathbf{i}-\\mathbf{j}+3\\mathbf{k}\\).

Sketch the graphs of the following functions on the interval \\(-2\\le x \\le 2\\). \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}(x+1)\\) \\(y=x^2+2\\) \\(y=-2x^2+2\\) \\(y=x^2-x-1\\) \\(y=3^x\\) \\(y=\\frac{1}{x}\\) Tips: find where the functions cross the axes; use completing the square to find the maximum or minimum of quadratics; identify any asymptotes. Answers: Expanding: \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{1}{2}\\) which we recognise as a line with gradient \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and y intercept \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Solving for \\(y=0\\) gives the x intercept as \\((-1,0)\\). This is a parabola shifted up by 2 units. This is an upside down parabola, shifted up by two units. Completing the square \\(y=(x-\\frac{1}{2})^2-\\frac{5}{4}\\). Since the squared term is always non-negative, it is smallest when it is zero at \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\). This is the position of the minimum, and at this point \\(y=-\\frac{5}{4}\\). Factorising: \\((x-\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})(x-\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2})\\), so the curve crosses the x axis at \\(x=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\). Since the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. This is an exponential \\(a^x\\) with \\(a&gt;1\\). All exponential functions cross the y axis at \\(a^0=1\\) and the do not cross the \\(x\\) axis. This is a rational function with a vertical asymptote at \\(x=0\\). It is small and positive for large positive values of \\(x\\) and it is small and negative for large negative values of \\(x\\): the line \\(y=0\\) is a horizontal asymptote. Sketch the following graphs (with \\(x\\) in radians): \\(y=\\sin(x)\\) \\(y=\\sin(x+\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\) (does this look familiar?) \\(y=\\sin(2x)\\) \\(y=\\sin^2(x)\\) Answers: You should be familiar with this graph and the location of maxima, minima and axis intercepts. Note that \\(\\sin(x+\\frac{\\pi}{2})=\\cos(x)\\). This is double the angular frequency of the usual sine function. Note that all the y values are non-negative.

Consider the cases: \\(a&gt;1\\) \\(0 &lt; a &lt; 1\\) \\(-1 &lt; a &lt; 0\\) \\(a&lt;-1\\) Answers: For \\(a&gt;1\\), the graph is squeezed along the x axis, with the value at \\(x=0\\) remaining unchanged. For \\(0 &lt; a &lt;1\\), the graph is expanded along the x axis, again with the value at \\(x=0\\) unchanged. For \\(-1 &lt; a &lt;0\\), the graph is again expanded, along the x axis, but the minus sign in \\(a\\) also means that the graph is reflected in the y axis. For \\(a&lt;-1\\), the graph is squeezed horizontally and reflected in the y axis.

The two solutions are \\[ x=1,y=1\\quad\\text{and }x =5,y=-3 \\] Solve the following inequalities. \\(7-3x&gt;x-5\\) \\(x^2\\ge 4\\) \\(x^2-x-6&lt;0\\) \\(x^2-3x-12\\le 2x+2\\) \\(\\frac{2}{2x-1} &gt; \\frac{3}{3x+1}\\) \\(\\frac{2x}{x-5}\\le 3\\) \\(x^3-9x^2&lt;0\\) Answers: \\[\\begin{align*} 7-3x &amp;&gt; x-5\\\\ 13 &amp;&gt; 4x\\\\ x &amp;&lt; \\frac{13}{4} \\end{align*}\\] Here, we must include both the positive and the negative solution to the square root: \\[\\begin{align*} x^2 &amp;\\geq 4\\\\ \\pm x &amp;\\geq 2\\\\ x\\geq 2 &amp; x\\leq -2 \\end{align*}\\] It is often worth sketching the graph and examining the inequality to determine where the inequality is satisfied. \\[ x^2 - x - 6 &lt; 0 \\\\ (x+2)(x-3) &lt; 0 \\] The graph of \\(x^2\\) will form a \\(\\cup\\) shape, so the parts below the axis are between the crossing points of \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x=3\\). So the inequality is satisfied for \\[ -2&lt;x&lt;3 \\] Note the use of strict inequalities \\(x&lt;3\\) and \\(x&gt;-2\\) because the inequality is \\(&lt;0\\) (as opposed to \\(\\leq\\)). Group terms to form a quadratic, find the solutions and determine whether the interval between them or outside of them satisfied the inequality: \\[\\begin{align*} x ^2 - 3x - 12 &amp;\\leq 2x + 2\\\\ x^2 - 5x - 14 &amp;\\leq 0\\\\ (x-7)(x+2)&amp;\\leq 0 \\end{align*}\\] And the part of the curve below the axis is the range \\(-2\\leq x \\leq 7\\) Do not multiply through by a variable, since at times the term will be negative and necessitate a flip of the inequality. Instead, subtract one side from both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{2x-1} &amp;&gt; \\frac{3}{3x+1}\\\\ \\frac{2}{2x-2} - \\frac{3}{3x+1} &amp;&gt; 0\\\\ \\frac{2(3x+1) - 3(2x-1)}{(2x-1)(3x+1)} &amp;&gt; 0\\\\ \\frac{5}{(2x-1)(3x+1)} &amp;&gt; 0 \\end{align*}\\] In order for the inequality to hold, either both terms in the denominator are positive or both are negative. \\[ \\text{positve case: }2x-1&gt;0,\\quad 3x+1 &gt; 0\\\\ x &gt; \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ and } x &gt; \\frac{1}{3}\\\\ x &gt; \\frac{1}{2}\\\\ \\text{negative case: }2x-2 &lt; 0, \\quad 3x+1 &lt; 0\\\\ x&lt;\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ and } x &lt; \\frac{1}{3}\\\\ x &lt; \\frac{1}{3} \\] So the final solution is \\(x &gt; \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x &lt; \\frac{1}{3}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2x}{x-5} &amp;\\leq 3 \\\\ \\frac{2x}{x-5} - 3 &amp;\\leq 0\\\\ \\frac{2x - 3(x-5)}{x-5} &amp; \\leq 0\\\\ \\frac{15-x}{x-5}&amp;\\leq 0 \\end{align*}\\] Which will ony old if one of the numerator or denominator is negative. So the inequality is solved by \\(x\\geq 15\\) and \\(x\\leq 5\\). Here, a cubic is presented, but a factor of \\(x^2\\) can be taken out \\[\\begin{align*} x^3 - 9x^2 &amp;&lt; 0 \\\\ x^2(x-9) &amp;&lt; 0\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] The \\(x^2\\) factor is always positive, so the whole inequality holds when \\(x-9\\) is negative. Hence, \\(x&lt;9\\) "],["exercise-set-6.html", "Exercise Set 6", " Exercise Set 6 Use Gaussian elimination (elementary row operations) to determine whether or not the following systems of equations have solutions, and, when they do, to find all solutions. In the cases where there is more than one solution, find the general solution and also give one particular solution. (Tip: Choosing the elementary row operations carefully can minimise the use of fractions). \\[\\begin{align*} x + y - z &amp;= -3, \\\\ 2x + 2y - z &amp;= -2, \\\\ 3x + 2y - 3z&amp;= -7; \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 2x - 2y + 3z&amp;= 5, \\\\ 3x - 2y + 4z&amp;= 6, \\\\ 4x + y + 2z&amp;= 2; \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 3x + 2y + 13z&amp;= 2, \\\\ 4x + 2y + 16z&amp;= 1, \\\\ x + y + 5z &amp;= 1; \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 2x + z &amp;= 3, \\\\ x + y + z &amp;= 2, \\\\ x + 3y + 2z&amp;= 3; \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 2x + 4y + z - 3t&amp;= 7, \\\\ 5x + 10y + 6z - 4t&amp;= 14, \\\\ 7x + 14y + 5z - 9t&amp;= 23; \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 3x + 4y &amp;= 1, \\\\ 2x - 4y + 2z&amp;= 4, \\\\ 3x + z &amp;= 2, \\\\ x - 2y + z &amp;= 2; \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 3x - y + 2z + t&amp;= 3, \\\\ x + 2y - z + t&amp;= -3, \\\\ 3x + y + z + t&amp;= 0, \\\\ 3x + 2y + t&amp;= -1. \\end{align*}\\] Balancing chemical equations. In the combustion of propane gas, propane (\\(C_3H_8\\)) combines with oxygen (\\(O_2\\)) to form carbon dioxide (\\(CO_2\\)) and water (\\(H_2O\\)) according to the equation \\[x_1 C_3H_8 + x_2 O_2\\to x_3CO_2+x_4H_2O.\\] To balance this equation, we must find natural numbers \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\) such that the total numbers of \\(C\\), \\(H\\) and \\(O\\) atoms are equal on both sides. Formulate this problem as a set of linear equations and solve using Guassian elimination. Electrical networks. Consider the circuit diagram below. The voltage drop across a resistor is (by Ohms law) \\(V=IR\\) where \\(V\\) is in volts, the current \\(I\\) is in amps and the resistance \\(R\\) is in ohms. Kirchhoffs junction law: the sum of currents flowing into a junction is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that junction. Kirchoffs Voltage law: The sum of the voltage drops in one direction around a loop equals the sum of the voltage sources in the same direction around the loop. Using these laws it is possible to derive the following set of linear equations for the currents \\(I_1, I_2, I_3\\): \\[\\begin{align*} 11I_1-3I_2&amp;=30\\\\ -3I_1+6I_2-I_3&amp;=5\\\\ -I_2+3I_3&amp;=-25. \\end{align*}\\] Determine the currents. (Extra challenge: derive the equations!). Network analysis. The diagram below represents the traffic flow in a one-way road network. Each directed edge represents a one-way road and is labelled with the flow through that road. The nodes represent road junctions. By considering the flow in and out of each node and the total flow in and out of the network, formulate a system of linear equations for the unknown flows \\(x_1,\\dotsc,x_5\\) and solve them by Gaussian elimination. You will find there is a free variable, but the requirement for non-negative flows puts some restrictions on the variables. In particular, what are the restrictions on \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_5\\)?
