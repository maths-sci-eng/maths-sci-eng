# Numerical Methods {#numerics}


In general, many mathematical problems do not have algebraic solution methods. Instead, we need to resort to *numerical methods*. This usually results in an approximate solution: we get an answer that is close to the true solution $x$, but might have an error $\varepsilon$, so that we obtain some value in the interval $x-\varepsilon$ to $x+\varepsilon$. For many practical applications an approximate solution is "good enough".

## Numerical Root Finding

We have seen how to solve linear and quadratic equations algebraically. We mentioned in section \@ref(polynomials) that there also exist formulae for finding roots of cubic and quartic polynomial equations, but not quintic or higher.

We often need to find the roots (values of $x$ for which $f(x)=0$) of some function
